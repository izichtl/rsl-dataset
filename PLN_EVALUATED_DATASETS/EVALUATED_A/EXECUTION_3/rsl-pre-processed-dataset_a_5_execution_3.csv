107.0,Excluded,ec3,A dynamic spectrum access network based on cognitive radio,"Dynamic spectrum access technologies based on Cognitive Radio (CR) is under intensive research carried out by the wireless communication society and is expected to solve the problem of spectrum scarcity. However, most enabling technologies related to dynamic spectrum access are considered individually. In this paper, we consider these key technologies jointly and introduce a new implementation scheme for a Dynamic Spectrum Access Network Based on Cognitive Radio (DSAN-BCR). We start with a flexible hardware platform for DSAN-BCR, as well as a flexible protocol structure that dominates the operation of DSAN-BCR. We then focus on the state of the art of key technologies such as spectrum sensing, spectrum resources management, dynamic spectrum access, and routing that are below the network layer in DSAN-BCR, as well as the development of technologies related to higher layers. Last but not the least, we analyze the challenges confronted by these mentioned technologies in DSAN-BCR, and give the perspectives on the future development of these technologies. The DSAN-BCR introduced is expected to provide a system level guidance to alleviate the problem of spectrum scarcity.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements in software projects using agile methodologies (violates EC3).

1959.0,Excluded,ec3,Progress on standardization and automation in software development on \{W7X\},"For a complex experiment like \{W7X\} being subject to changes all along its projected lifetime the advantages of a formalized software development method have already been stated [1]. Quality standards like ISO/IEC-12207 provide a guideline for structuring of development work and improving process and product quality. A considerable number of tools has emerged supporting and automating parts of development work. On \{W7X\} progress has been made during the last years in exploiting the benefit of automation and management during software development:â€“ Continuous build, integration and automated test of software artefacts.âˆ˜ Syntax checks and code quality metrics. âˆ˜ Documentation generation. âˆ˜ Feedback for developers by temporal statistics. â€“ Versioned repository for build products (libraries, executables). â€“ Separate snapshot and release repositories and automatic deployment. â€“ Semi-automatic provisioning of applications. â€“ Feedback from testers and feature requests by ticket system. This toolset is working efficiently and allows the team to concentrate on development. The activity there is presently focused on increasing the quality of the existing software to become a dependable product. Testing of single functions and qualities must be simplified. So a restructuring is underway which relies more on small, individually testable components with standardized interfaces providing the capability to construct arbitrary function aggregates for dedicated tests of quality attributes as availability, reliability, performance. A further activity is on improving the development cycle. The use of release cycles has already provided favourable concentration of work and predictability of delivery times. However, the demand has risen, to react quickly on priority changes from W7X-project management. So a more agile development cycle is being prepared relying on smaller working packages, shorter release cycles and an associated release plan giving the software development responsible the possibility to react on a shorter time scale.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address any agile methodology specifically, violating Exclusion Criterion EC7.

2046.0,Excluded,ec3,Reputation-based self-management of software process artifact quality in consortium research projects,"This paper proposes a PhD research that deals with improving internal documentation in software projects. Software developers often do not like to create documentation because it has few value to the individual himself. Yet the purpose of internal documentation is to help others understand the software and the problem it addresses. Documentation increases development speed, reduces software maintenance costs, helps to keep development on track, and mitigates the negative effects of distance in distributed settings. This research aims to increase the individuals' motivation to write documentation by means of reputation. The CollabReview prototype is a web-based reputation system that analyzes artifacts of internal documentation to derive personal reputation scores. Developers making many good contributions will achieve higher reputation scores. These scores can then be employed to softly influence developer behavior, e.g. by incentivizing them to contribute to documentation with social rewards. No strict rule enforcement is necessary.",EXCLUDED,"The article is a PhD research proposal (a draft) and falls under EC4 (the study is incomplete, a draft, presentation slides, or just an abstract).

2438.0,Excluded,ec3,The Combination of Agile and Lean in Software Development: An Experience Report Analysis,"There has been a noticeable focus shift from agile methods such as extreme Programming (XP) and Scrum to lean software development in the last several years, which is indicated as ""from agile to lean"". However, the reality may not be as simple or linear as the term implies. To provide a better understanding of the combined use of agile and lean approaches in software development, a set of experience reports were analysed. These reports were published in the past conferences dedicated to agile software development and report experiences of using both agile and lean. The results of the analysis show that agile and lean can be combined in different manners for different purposes in software development. Lean is often applied as guiding principles for agile development. When combined at practice level, flow-based lean processes tend to substitute time-boxed agile processes.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software development requirements using agile and lean methodologies, as required by IC1.

652.0,Included,included,Balancing agile and structured development approaches to successfully manage large distributed software projects: A case study from the cruise line industry,"Agile methods and traditional structured approaches are often viewed as competing bi-polar choices. Agile methods such as Scrum and XP are recommended for small, co-located projects that involve changing requirements. The traditional structured plan-driven approaches, such as the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and the waterfall lifecycle frameworks, are recommended for large projects with stable requirements. If a project is large, strategically important, distributed, and has dynamic user requirements and organizational changes, it presents unique challenges that neither the agile methods nor the traditional structured approaches can effectively deal with alone. Although there is an increasing call for a balanced approach, there is little empirical research that shows when and how the two approaches can complement each other. Based on a case study from the cruise line industry of a large distributed strategic project with unanticipated changes, we conclude that this balance is not only workable, but is essential to ensure that the project demonstrates both control and agility for achieving its challenging and dynamic goals. Agile without structure can cause chaos, particularly in large complex distributed projects where planning, control, and coordination are critical. Structure without agility can lead to rigidity, particularly when a project involves a great deal of learning, discovery, and changes.

The need for usable products is also a growing factor for organizations. Thus, their development processes have to react on mis demand and have to offer approaches to integrate the factor ""usability"" in their development processes. The approach presented in this paper evaluates how agile software engineering models consider activities of Usability Engineering to ensure the creation of usable software products. The user-centeredness of the two agile SE models Scrum and XP has been analyzed and the question of how potential gaps can be filled without loosing the process' agility is discussed.

162.0,Excluded,ec3,A Methodology for Assessing Agile Software Development Methods,"Agile methods provide an organization or a team with the flexibility to adopt a selected subset of principles and practices based on their culture, their values, and the types of systems that they develop. More specifically, every organization or team implements a customized agile method, tailored to better accommodate its needs. However, the extent to which a customized method supports the organizational objectives, i.e. the `goodness' of that method, is questionable. Existing agile assessment approaches focus on comparative analyses, or are limited in scope and application. In this research, we propose a structured, systematic, and comprehensive approach to assessing the `goodness' of agile methods. We examine an agile method based on (1) its adequacy, (2) the capability of the organization to support the adopted principles and practices specified by the method, and (3) the method's effectiveness. We propose the Objectives, Principles and Practices (OPP) Framework to guide our assessment. The Framework identifies (1) objectives of the agile philosophy, (2) principles that support the objectives, (3) practices that are reflective of the principles, (4) linkages among the objectives, principles and practices, and (5) indicators for assessing the extent to which an organization supports the implementation and the effectiveness of that practice.

These studies found that agile methods are well suited to the exploratory, iterative, and collaborative nature of scientific inquiry. However, these findings might not be applicable in all situations pertaining to scientific software development projects. In addition, they only constitute a subset of the important factors while deciding which development methods and practices should be adopted. Therefore, it becomes important to conduct further research before making recommendations regarding the adoption of certain development methods and practices in this domain. In this progress report, we discuss our on-going research that will empirically study the characteristics of various scientific software development projects according to a model suggested by Boehm and Turner. We plan to conduct interviews and collect data from various scientific software development projects in the Baltimore-Washington area. We expect that our qualitative results will increase our understanding of the characteristics in those projects favoring plan-driven approaches or agile methods, and the needs and conditions associated with those characteristics. Our research provides guidance to scientific software developers by enhancing their capacity to evaluate and understand their own project characteristics and select effective software practices.

Key characteristics of agile methods are lean and highly iterative development with a strong emphasis on stakeholder involvement. \{PLE\} leverages reuse through systematic approaches such as variability modeling or product derivation. Integrating agile approaches with product line engineering is an interesting proposition which â€“ not surprisingly â€“ entails several challenges: Product lines (PL) rely on complex plans and models to ensure their long-term evolution while agile methods emphasize simplicity and short-term value-creation for customers. When incorporating agility in product line engineering, it is thus essential to define carefully how agile principles can support particular \{PLE\} processes. For instance, the processes of defining and setting up a product line (domain engineering) and deriving products (application engineering) differ significantly in practices and focus with implications on the suitability of agile principles. This paper presents practical experiences of adopting agile principles in product line planning (a domain engineering activity). ThinkLets, i.e., collaborative practices from the area of collaboration engineering, are the building blocks of the presented approach as they codify agile principles such as stakeholder involvement, rapid feedback, or value-based prioritization.

The active vision paradigm is an effort to address these issues by enabling the seeing agent to manipulate its visual parameters in time and space so as to simplify its computational tasks and solve for the ambiguities in the process of visual perception. In this paper it is argued that if the goal of research in computational vision is considered to be that of understanding and designing seeing systems, then we need a design strategy. In our particular case, the design strategy has been influenced by anthropomorphic qualities. The empirical nature of such research also requires systems by which one can perform experiments in real-time and in interaction with the environment. This criterion has also been an important guide-line in the design of the system. The need for the manipulation of the visual parameters is a typical application of mechatronicsâ€”the interaction between the mechanics and electronicsâ€” of a complex perceptual system. By an analysis based on observations from the primate visual system, we describe the design of such a system. Details of its implementation and performance are also provided.

Several reports from large companies such as Bosch, Nokia, Philips and Siemens witness gains and benefits achieved with their use, especially with respect to the reduction on time to market. In SPL development, domain analysis plays a central role where the relevant features are identified. Feature-Oriented Domain Analysis is a method which uses a feature model to specify variabilities and commonalities of an SPL. However, activities related to the Domain Analysis process (managing commonalities and variabilities, with users visibility and relevant stakeholders) in most cases, do not seem to be a simple and easy activity, since to represent these analyzes in modelling domain tools with a certain degree of formality, requires a technical knowledge that domain experts do not always have it prior to use. But creative requirements techniques have been suggested to facilitate the elicitation activity by filling the gap the communications problems between domain experts and software engineers, making the domain analysis more agile.

The objective of the proposed dissertation project is to develop a similar pattern based approach that helps in analysing requirements from different disciplines and making them comprehensible for all stakeholders who need to agree to a requirement specification as the deliverable of requirements engineering. Due to the importance of legal aspects for, and users' trust in, socio-technical systems, requirement patterns will be developed for these two aspects. For the legal requirement patterns, legal requirements that are stable concerning changes due to their origin in fundamental, higher-ranked laws will be collected, and requirement patterns will be derived from them.

375.0,Included,included,Agile development: issues and avenues requiring a substantial enhancement of the business perspective in large projects,"Large-scale projects, are often delivering low value software to businesses due to stakeholders' misunderstanding. Evolutionary software development represents an alternative to plan-driven development in order to tackle today's turbulent environments. In agile development, a type of evolutionary development, the product owner (P.O.) who is the customer representative---real accountable role---is ill-equipped to identify and prioritize the stakeholders' most success-critical expectations and potential sources of business value. Furthermore, the tools he can use have their own scalability issues that question their underlying principles. Moreover, without a substantial involvement to take into account all stakeholders, software providers are more likely acting as commodity-utility providers than real business partners. In today's business context, there is a clear need for a value-driven development which embraces changes along with higher visibility and understanding of business transformations.
The current problems of software crisis could be condensed in a twofold business perspective dilemma: Doing the right product and providing efficient guidance to the development project. Approaches based on goals have been successfully used in Requirements Engineering (RE) and IT governance to address issues similar to the current software crisis. Commonalities in motivations behind the use of goals in both domains can open new avenues for improving the business perspective in Scrum.

These methodologies, such as Scrum, eXtreme Programming (XP), and Feature-Driven Development (FDD) date back to 1990s, and the Agile Manifesto was declared in 2001. However, already before that the concept of agile manufacturing (AM) was discovered to describe a corporate ability for quick adaptation to changing requirements. There is surprising amount in common between these two fields. This raises a question of whether NPD software development companies could take even more overall advantage of those different agile approaches. This interdisciplinary paper explores the commonalities between the key concepts of AM and some of the most popular agile software methods, and consequently suggests potential new areas for software process improvement (SPI) in large-scale NPD organizations. An industrial case example illustrates how agility in embedded software product development can be enhanced by following typical NPD principles. We conclude that there is potential for further improvements in software product development industry in general by seeing agility as a wider, organization-oriented business concept following the AM/NPD learning.

2754.0,Excluded,ec3,Using stakeholder-driven process performance measurement for monitoring the performance of a Scrum-based software development process,We describe a metrics plan for monitoring and improving the performance of the software development process based on the Scrum agile method. After a short introduction to Scrum concepts a detailed description of the proposed metrics is provided. The metrics are defined using the principles of stakeholder-driven process performance measurement that requires a balanced approach considering viewpoints of different stakeholders. The goals of each stakeholder are defined first followed by the choice of appropriate performance indicators. The evaluation of each indicator is based on metric values collected during process execution. The metrics plan enables a stepwise introduction of metrics which can be incorporated into the Scrum method seamlessly without affecting the agility of the development process.,INCLUDED,"The article addresses software project requirements using the Scrum agile methodology (satisfies IC1 and IC7). It is a descriptive study providing a metrics plan for monitoring performance, which falls under qualitative research (satisfies IC3).

193.0,Included,included,A plea for lean software process models,"Over the last 30 years we have tried very hard the rich process models approach, and we have not been extremely successful at it. Maybe we should try ""lean and mean"" software process models, rather than making them ""richer."" At minimum, we should try to analyze why the rich approaches have not worked; where they failed. Could it be that we were trying to solve the wrong problem? or that the real problems by far overshadow the process model issue? Or maybe the whole construction paradigm we use for software development is not suitable anymore? My position is that we should try the route of very simple software process models, to ensure a wider applicability, greater versatility, and acceptance. Possibly these new process models would be based on other paradigms of software or system development than the ""technical-rational"" construction idea. I would be wary of richer process models.",EXCLUDED,"The article is a philosophical argument and opinion piece, not a study that addresses software requirements or agile methodologies. It does not present empirical research, lacks a specific research question, and fails to address any agile methodology or software requirements, violating EC7 and EC9. Therefore, it is excluded."
1105.0,Included,included,Elaboration on an integrated architecture and requirement practice: Prototyping with quality attribute focus,"This experience report builds on an earlier study in which we interviewed eight project teams that were using iterative incremental lifecycles. In the study, we captured the practices the teams felt contributed to rapid delivery. We identified a mix of Agile and architecture practices that teams apply to rapidly field software and minimize disruption and delay. In this paper, we elaborate one practice from the study, prototyping with quality attribute focus. We compared two experiences in prototyping focused on quality attribute considerations applied on Scrum projects. We observe through interviews that feature development and prototyping practice spans multiple levels: feature development/sprint, release planning, and portfolio planning. We also observe other factors including rapid trade-off analysis, flexible architecture, and adoption of a set of enabling prototyping guidelines. The analysis of the observations sheds light on several aspects of the practice that enable the team to respond quickly and efficiently when prototype feedback suggests architectural change.

1541.0,Included,included,Investigating agile user-centered design in practice: A grounded theory perspective,"This paper investigates how the integration of agile methods and User-Centered Design (UCD) is carried out in practice. For this study, we have applied grounded theory as a suitable qualitative approach to determine what is happening in actual practice. The data was collected by semi-structured interviews with professionals who have already worked with an integrated agile UCD methodology. Further data was collected by observing these professionals in their working context, and by studying their documents, where possible. The emerging themes that the study found show that there is an increasing realization of the importance of usability in software development among agile team members. The requirements are emerging; and both low and high fidelity prototypes based usability tests are highly used in agile teams. There is an appreciation of each other's work from both UCD professionals and developers and both sides can learn from each other.

1078.0,Excluded,ec3,Dynamic networked organizations for software engineering,"Current practice in software engineering suggests a radical change in perspective: where once stood fixed teams of people following a development plan, now stand just-in-time Dynamic Networked Organizations (DyNOs), adopting a common flexible strategy for development, rather than a plan. This shift in perspective has gone relatively unnoticed by current software engineering research. This paper offers a glimpse at what processes and instruments lie beyond “current” software engineering research, where studying emergent DyNOs, their creation and steering becomes critical. To understand the underpinnings of this evolution, we explored a simple yet vivid scenario from real-life industrial practice. Using scenario analysis we elicited a number of social and organizational requirements in working with DyNOs. Also, comparing our evidence with literature, we made some key observations. First, managing DyNOs makes organizational requirements a first-class entity for development success. Second, research in software engineering should be invested in understanding and governing the DyNOs behind the software lifecycle.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements in the context of agile methodologies. Instead, it focuses on Dynamic Networked Organizations (DyNOs) and their organizational requirements, which falls outside the scope of software project requirements using agile methodologies as defined in the inclusion criteria.

1756.0,Included,included,NORPLAN: Non-functional requirements planning for agile processes,"Agile software development and project management methodologies, such as Scrum and Extreme Programming, have become very popular in quickly delivering quality Functional Requirements (FRs). However, agile project management methodologies have not adequately captured planning and prioritization activities for crosscutting concerns and non-functional requirements in agile practices. This research proposes project management and requirements quality metrics that would be used to design a risk-driven algorithm to prioritize and plan an improved requirements implementation sequence that is suitable for agile software development methodologies. Unlike the overly simplistic business value prioritization scheme used in methodologies such as Scrum, Non-functional Requirements Planning (NORPLAN) proposes two additional prioritization schemes, namely, Riskiest-Requirements-First and Riskiest-Requirements-Last for improved yet more agile planning for release and sprint cycles using a risk-driven approach. The approach is validated through visual simulation and a case study. Â© 2013 IEEE.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses non-functional requirements planning in agile software development methodologies like Scrum and Extreme Programming, satisfying IC1 (software requirements in agile contexts).
