995.0,Included,included,Dependable solutions design by Agile Modeled Layered Security Architectures,"Our research entitled ""Designing Dependable Agile Layered Security Architecture Solutions"" addresses the innovative idea and novel implementations of Security Engineering for Software Engineering using Agile Modeled Layered Security Architectures for Dependable Privacy Requirements, with a validation of an exemplar case study of Web Services Security Architectures. Securing the Software Architecture in any application at design phase is known as Security Architectures, and we focus on authentication and authorization of the user. Now a day most of the applications are developed as a Layered Security Architecture Pattern, typically we have user presentation layer, Business Logic Layer and Database access layer. Now Agile modeling is used in all applications design (but Agile Modeled Architectures are given little importance) because of shortened developed time, with customer collaborations with developers and importantly with Test Driven Development approaches. Securing Agile Modeled architectures, which being an iterative development, will provide enhanced Dependable Security Requirements in terms of Privacy of user, in its successive iterations. All this research paves a way for Secure Web Engineering.

Both students and practitioners have suggested that one of the popular, lighter-weight, agile methods would be a better choice. This paper examines the educational goals for undergraduate Software Engineering education and considers how they might be met by the practices of eXtreme Programming.

2123.0,Included,included,"Scenarios, personas and user stories: User-centered evidence-based design representations of communicable disease investigations","AbstractPurpose Despite years of effort and millions of dollars spent to create unified electronic communicable disease reporting systems, the goal remains elusive. A major barrier has been a lack of understanding by system designers of communicable disease (CD) work and the public health workers who perform this work. This study reports on the application of user-centered design representations, traditionally used for improving interface design, to translate the complex \{CD\} work identified through ethnographic studies to guide designers and developers of \{CD\} systems. The purpose of this work is to: (1) better understand public health practitioners and their information workflow with respect to \{CD\} monitoring and control at a local health agency, and (2) to develop evidence-based design representations that model this \{CD\} work to inform the design of future disease surveillance systems. Methods We performed extensive onsite semi-structured interviews, targeted work shadowing and a focus group to characterize local health agency \{CD\} workflow. Informed by principles of design ethnography and user-centered design we created persona, scenarios and user stories to accurately represent the user to system designers. Results We sought to convey to designers the key findings from ethnographic studies: (1) public health \{CD\} work is mobile and episodic, in contrast to current \{CD\} reporting systems, which are stationary and fixed, (2) health agency efforts are focused on \{CD\} investigation and response rather than reporting and (3) current \{CD\} information systems must conform to public health workflow to ensure their usefulness. In an effort to illustrate our findings to designers, we developed three contemporary design-support representations: persona, scenario, and user story. Conclusions Through application of user-centered design principles, we were able to create design representations that illustrate complex public health communicable disease workflow and key user characteristics to inform the design of \{CD\} information systems for public health.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements or agile methodologies, violating Exclusion Criteria EC3 and EC7. It focuses on user-centered design representations for public health systems, not software project requirements in an agile context."
373.0,Excluded,ec3,Agile development: evaluation and experience,"Agile methods such as Extreme Programming, Crystal, Scrum, and others have attracted a lot of attention recently. Agile methods stress early and continuous delivery of software, welcome changing requirements, and value early feedback from customers. Agile methods seek to cut out inefficiency, bureaucracy, and anything that adds no value to a software product. Proponents of agile methods often see software specification and documentation as adding no value, which has led observers to conclude that agile development is nothing but unprincipled hacking, perhaps even an anarchic counter-reaction to bureaucratic, heavyweight software processes that demand ever more intermediate deliverables from developers. The purpose of this panel is to discuss under what circumstances agile methods work and don't work. Some of the key practices of agile methods are: scheduling according to feature priorities, incremental delivery of software, feedback from expert users, emphasis on face-to-face communication, pair development, minimalist design combined with refactoring, test-driven development, automated regression testing, daily integration, self-organizing teams, and periodic tuning of the methods. Working software is the primary measure of success. Find out what the latest practical experience with agile methods is and learn about the latest thinking in this area.",EXCLUDED,"The article is a panel discussion abstract that does not present a study addressing software requirements or answer specific research questions.

An Experience Using Data Collection and Feedback,"Several works on agile methods discuss the use of team's workspace for displaying relevant information. The management of an Informative Workspace (IW) is a challenging task as it can involve many different subjects such as team adaptability, continuous reflection, workspace layout, human cognition, usability, etc. Our paper explores the IW management and it is divided in two phases. The first phase describes a data collection performed on 8 agile teams in order to identify valuable aspects on managing an IW based on their experiences. We proposed a series of suggestions to the teams in order to improve their current context using their IW and we gathered the feedbacks. This process leds to a set of seven heuristics for managing an IW. On the second phase, in order to reinforce the heuristics validity, a five point Likert scale survey was applied resulting mostly in positive evaluations. At the end of these two phases, we associate the seven proposed heuristics, when possible, to available considerations on other agile community references.",INCLUDED,"The article is written in English (EC1 not violated).

2054.0,Excluded,ec7,Requirements Composition Table Explained," Aspect-oriented requirements engineering (AORE) introduced an artifact called Requirements Composition Table (RCT). RCT presents a holistic view of an application's functionality structured by core features and crosscutting concerns. This artifact can effectively support various project tasks and serve as a common frame of reference for all parties on a project team. As AORE remains little-known to most practitioners in the software development field, the purpose of this paper is to explain the RCT concept to practitioners and discuss its benefits. The RCT technique has been implemented for a number of Wall Street applications at various investment banks. RCT can help us perform important project tasks and has proven to be one of the most valuable artifacts of a software project. This paper discusses the steps to develop an RCT, provides an example of how to use it to perform change impact analysis for releases, describes experiences using RCTs in practice, and discusses lessons learned on projects implementing the RCT technique.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements in the context of agile methodologies.

1226.0,Excluded,ec3,Extensible Prototyping for pragmatic engineering of knowledge-based systems,"Knowledge-based systems (KBSs) have been built and practically applied in various contexts for decades. Yet, they still challenge developers by their complexity: Apart from a sound knowledge base they likewise require comprehensive user interface (UI) and interaction design for supporting the task at hand optimally. However, current KBS-Engineering methodologies still mostly focus on knowledge base development, regarding UI/interaction design a more incidental, low priority task. Thus, the \{UI\} often is developed in a rather ad hoc manner, thereby neglecting the potential of experimental design and creating reusable solutions. The integration of (rapid) evolutionary prototyping activities with \{KBS\} Engineering offers the chance for incorporating UI/interaction design more prominently into the process while at the same time leveraging the overall development task; specifically, we propose Extensible Prototyping as a tailored prototyping approach and we suggest its integration with the Agile Process Model for knowledge-based systems in this paper. For practical support, we further introduce the customized prototyping and knowledge systems engineering tool ProKEt, and we report on practical experiences with applying both the approach and the tool.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements in the context of agile methodologies, as it focuses on UI/interaction design in knowledge-based systems and proposes a prototyping approach integrated with an agile process model, without explicitly addressing software requirements.

784.0,Included,included,Chapter 15 - Rapid \{CD\} and Other Methodologies,"Publisher Summary It is noted that the phases of rapid contextual design can be broken up into three fundamental partsâ€”namely, requirements gathering, work or activity redesign, and user experience design. These phases effectively maps well to any corporate or agile methodology particularly for basic requirements gathering, including business case, product or system requirements gathering, and personas and user scenarios. Rapid \{CD\} can easily supplement the deliverables required for the business analysis and requirements phases of most corporate processes. Paper prototyping is widely accepted as a means of testing design ideas and refining them. However, it should be accomplished with real user cases and not the canned test scenarios of some usability testing. The core of rapid \{CD\} is getting customer data and its implications into the design process and into the minds of designer and developers. It provides the data that is needed to guide business decisions, prioritize requirements, and produce high quality user experience. It is noted that rapid \{CD\} can augment other methods also.",EXCLUDED,"The article is a chapter from a publisher summary and does not present a study that addresses software requirements in the context of agile methodologies.

2779.0,Excluded,ec3,Visual data mining and analysis of software repositories,"In this article we describe an ongoing effort to integrate information visualization techniques into the process of configuration management for software systems. Our focus is to help software engineers manage the evolution of large and complex software systems by offering them effective and efficient ways to query and assess system properties using visual techniques. To this end, we combine several techniques from different domains, as follows. First, we construct an infrastructure that allows generic querying and data mining of different types of software repositories such as \{CVS\} and Subversion. Using this infrastructure, we construct several models of the software source code evolution at different levels of detail, ranging from project and package up to function and code line. Second, we describe a set of views that allow examining the code evolution models at different levels of detail and from different perspectives. We detail three views: the file view shows changes at line level across many versions of a single, or a few, files. The project view shows changes at file level across entire software projects. The decomposition view shows changes at subsystem level across entire projects. We illustrate how the proposed techniques, which we implemented in a fully operational toolset, have been used to answer non-trivial questions on several real-world, industry-size software projects. Our work is at the crossroads of applied software engineering (SE) and information visualization, as our toolset aims to tightly integrate the methods promoted by the InfoVis field into the \{SE\} practice.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements directly; instead, it focuses on visual data mining and analysis of software repositories, which is related to software evolution and visualization rather than software requirements.

Extreme designing follows on the footsteps of agile methods and is analogous to extreme programming. However, it is not radically committed to ""user interface coding"" (sketching or prototyping alone), but instead proposes to combine user interface sketches with a more structured representation such as an interaction model.

One characterization of software complexity is the existence of dependency relationship. Moreover, degree of dependency reflects the cohesion and coupling between software elements. Dependencies on design and implementation phase have been proven as important predictors for software bugs. We empirically investigated how requirements dependencies correlate with and predict software integration bugs, which can provide early estimate regarding software quality, therefore facilitate decision making early in the software lifecycle. We conducted network analysis on requirements dependency networks of two commercial software projects. We then performed correlation analysis between network measures (e.g., degree, closeness) and number of bugs. Afterwards, bug prediction models were built using these network measures. Significant correlation is observed between most of our network measures and number of bugs. These network measures can predict the number of bugs with high accuracy and sensitivity. We further identified the significant predictors for bug prediction. Besides, the indication effect of network measures on bug number varies among different types of requirements dependency. These observations show that requirements dependency network can be used as an early indicator of software Integration bugs.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements in the context of agile methodologies indirectly through early bug prediction in software integration, which relates to software project requirements.

Are agile methods here to stay? Some claim that agile software development methods are in the mainstream adoption phase in the software industry, while others hope that those are a passing fad. The assumption here is that if agile would not provide real improvement, adopters would be eager at first but turn pessimistic after putting it into practice. Objective Despite the growing amount of anecdotal evidence on the success of agile methods across a wide range of different real-life development settings, scientific studies remain scarce. Even less is known about the perception of the impacts of agile transformation when it is deployed in a very large software development environment, and whether agile methods are here to stay. This study aims to fill that gap by providing evidence from a large-scale agile transformation within Nokia. While we have yet to confirm these findings with solid quantitative data, we believe that the perception of the impacts already pinpoints the direction of the impacts of large-scale agile transformation. Method The data were collected using a questionnaire. The population of the study contains more than 1000 respondents in seven different countries in Europe, North America, and Asia. Results The results reveal that most respondents agree on all accounts with the generally claimed benefits of agile methods. These benefits include higher satisfaction, a feeling of effectiveness, increased quality and transparency, increased autonomy and happiness, and earlier detection of defects. Finally, 60% of respondents would not like to return to the old way of working. Conclusion While the perception of the impact of agile methods is predominantly positive, several challenge areas were discovered.

1522.0,Excluded,ec3,Interaction Design in an Engineering-Centric World,"Publisher Summary It is hard to imagine any design training that doesn't include process as a significant part of the studio experience. Put simply, process drives repeatabilityâ€”reducing the reliance on inspirationâ€”and creates a framework in which creative professionals can execute. Developers and engineers are also familiar with the use of process as a framework in which to increase the odds of repeatable results, and most have training and experience using a variety of software development processes. However, most have little experience with the â€œunderstand, design, validate, deliverâ€� sorts of processes frequently applied in design disciplines. Their own experience using a variety of engineering processes creates common ground for the two disciplines, and creates opportunities for setting expectations between the disciplines. In the design process, it is not uncommon to have to return to previous phases. Particularly in environments where clients or executives have the vision themselves to recognize that designers are not on a path to success, it is not uncommon to return to gather broader understanding about a domain, or competitors, or influences.

This paper proposes an auditing model for ISO 9001 traceability requirements that is applicable in agile (XP) environments. The design of our model is based on evaluation theory, and includes the use of several auditing ""yardsticks"" derived from the principles of engineering design, the SWEBOK Guide, and the CMMI-DEV guidelines for requirement management and traceability for each yardstick.

Another aspect of business process modeling involves the accurate capture of operational behavior and the associated process constraints. Whether the process is automated or manual, such operational constraints and behavior exist. This may include a variety of properties including performance expectations, policy constraints, and security controls. These characteristics later manifest as the non-functional requirements of an intended system, and often such information is generally identified at some point after the business process modeling exercise. The non-functional characteristics of the business are arguably more difficult to capture in business process modeling, since the focus of such methods is the modeling of functional behavior. We propose how two new artifacts may be applied to model the constraints associated with a business process. This is the operating condition to denote a business process constraint and the control case to define controlling criteria to mitigate risk associated with an operational condition. Modeling constraints in this way provides an opportunity to capture these characteristics of business process early in the systems development life-cycle. This contributes to a model that provides a more complete representation of the overall business process. The methods will assist in mitigating risk and facilitate the early discovery of non-functional requirements during systems development.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements or agile methodologies, violating Exclusion Criteria EC3 and EC7.

Two main processes are to be established: creating a reusable infrastructure, and utilizing it for developing products. In practice, these two processes cannot strictly be separated as product enhancements are requested frequently by customers and a changeable infrastructure is essential to react on market needs. Thus, various approaches, such as proactive, reactive, or agile, have been introduced to handle changes. At a finer level of granularity, however, changes comprise many activities with variable duration and thus result in sets of concurrent and overlapping software development activities. This paper, therefore, investigates changes in more detail and assumes that provisioning comprehensive information on changes and respective states are crucial to organizations for keeping a software product line manageable. As features are a common notion used in software engineering to reflect customer requirements, the paper proposes a conceptual framework for managing feature information and for defining role-specific views throughout all life cycle processes.

How can one capitalize on the strengths of agile development models while still appealing to established software engineering practices? The typical introductory software engineering course makes use of a team-based project to reinforce software process activities. The project normally runs for one academic term during which students are led through life-cycle activities using a modified waterfall approach to software development. While useful in teaching software engineering process concepts, this approach limits the team's ability to utilize feedback from downstream process activities. It also limits the students' opportunity to understand process improvement from their own experiences. The ability to respond to project change is also dampened by the fact that teams do not have the time or resources in this format to modify, or refactor the design of a project component let alone incorporate a new or modified customer requirement. Agile methodologies promote an evolutionary approach to development using short incremental release cycles. We report on the experiences of conducting a team project in an introductory software engineering course using agile development techniques at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Teams have the opportunity to experience multiple iterations of the software engineering life cycle and evolve a product design that allows for discoveries made during implementation and through the introduction of changing customer requirements. The project integrates the concept of test-driven development. This agile technique addresses testing early in the development process and reinforces the value of unit testing.

Specially, in determining access control to resources, contextual information can play an important role. Access control models, as studied in traditional computing security, however, have no notion of context-awareness; and the recent works in the nascent field of context-aware access control predominantly focus on spatio-temporal contexts, disregarding a host of other pertinent contexts.

1647.0,Included,included,Managing software projects with business-based requirements,"For many organizations that are neither software product companies nor system integrators, the expense and cultural change required for full process rollout can be prohibitive. Proponents of agile processes/methods (such as extreme programming) suggest that these ""lightweight"" approaches are extremely effective. I would agree that there are many powerful aspects within these approaches. I suggest, however, that by taking an objective-based business requirements approach to project management, software projects have a high probability of running on time, and remaining in scope and within budget. Addressing requirement challenges, independent of adopting a full process, can offer many of the benefits of full process adoption while avoiding most of the expense and human issues involved with full process rollout. A business-based requirements approach is an easy-to-adopt, risk-free entry point that offers tangible quality improvements. This approach suits any project scope. Whether building a complex system for enterprise resource planning or customer relationship management, or developing small, single-user software programs, defining business requirements improves any system delivery.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address any agile methodology (violates EC7), and instead proposes a business-based requirements approach as an alternative to agile processes.

468.0,Included,included,"Ahaa --agile, hybrid assessment method for automotive, safety critical smes","The need for software is increasingly growing in the automotive industry. Software development projects are, however, often troubled by time and budget overruns, resulting in systems that do not fulfill customer requirements. Both research and industry lack strategies to combine reducing the long software development lifecycles (as required by time-to-market demands) with increasing the quality of the software developed. Software process improvement (SPI) provides the first step in the move towards software quality, and assessments are a vital part of this process. Unfortunately, software process assessments are often expensive and time consuming. Additionally, they often provide companies with a long list of issues without providing realistic suggestions. The goal of this paper is to describe a new low-overhead assessment method that has been designed specifically for small-to-medium-sized (SMEs) organisations wishing to be automotive software suppliers. This assessment method integrates the structured-ness of the plan-driven SPI models of Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) and Automotive SPICE with the flexibleness of agile practices.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements in agile methodologies (specifically, a hybrid assessment method combining CMMI and Automotive SPICE with agile practices) in the context of SMEs in the automotive industry.

We extend an existing framework of inherent risks in RE by adding knowledge from literature and a case study. We show how ATDD can be seen as a mix of the traditional RE focus on documentation and the agile focus on iterative communication. ATDD can mitigate some of the inherent risks in RE. It also carries with it the need for a proper domain and a very rigorous development method that requires disciplined developers and dedicated customers, preferably on-site.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements engineering in agile contexts, specifically focusing on automated acceptance test-driven development (ATDD).

2235.0,Included,included,Software process improvement through the Lean Measurement (SPI-LEAM) method,"Software process improvement methods help to continuously refine and adjust the software process to improve its performance (e.g., in terms of lead-time, quality of the software product, reduction of change requests, and so forth). Lean software development propagates two important principles that help process improvement, namely identification of waste in the process and considering interactions between the individual parts of the software process from an end-to-end perspective. A large shift of thinking about the own way of working is often required to adopt lean. One of the potential main sources of failure is to try to make a too large shift about the ways of working at once. Therefore, the change to lean has to be done in a continuous and incremental way. In response to this we propose a novel approach to bring together the quality improvement paradigm and lean software development practices, the approach being called Software Process Improvement through the Lean Measurement (SPI-LEAM) Method. The method allows to assess the performance of the development process and take continuous actions to arrive at a more lean software process over time. The method is under implementation in industry and an initial evaluation of the method has been performed.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements in software projects using agile methodologies by proposing the SPI-LEAM method, which integrates lean principles with process improvement.
