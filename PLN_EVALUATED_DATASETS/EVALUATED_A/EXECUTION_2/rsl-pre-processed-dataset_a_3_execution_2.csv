1655.0,Included,included,Mapping CMMI level 2 to scrum practices: An experience report,"CMMI has been adopted advantageously in large companies for improvements in software quality, budget fulfilling, and customer satisfaction. However SPI strategies based on CMMI-DEV require heavy software development processes and large investments in terms of cost and time that medium/small companies do not deal with. The so-called light software development processes, such as Agile Software Development (ASD), deal with these challenges. ASD welcomes changing requirements and stresses the importance of adaptive planning, simplicity and continuous delivery of valuable software by short time-framed iterations. ASD is becoming convenient in a more and more global, and changing software market. It would be greatly useful to be able to introduce agile methods such as Scrum in compliance with CMMI process model.

A major difficulty with such systems is requirements elicitation, because intimate knowledge of the work processes is needed to identify the potential agent application scenarios. In the face of uncertain requirements, our methodology exploits some ideas from agile software development approaches such as Extreme Programming, namely the values of collaboration with domain experts and of human creativity driven by rapid feedback. We support collaboration by means of a tool-supported modeling approach that allows one to capture existing and agentified processes in a format that is sufficiently simple to be understood and maintained by domain experts. These process models can be automatically synchronized with executable agent source code, so that rapid feedback is ensured. We support creativity by means of a searchable repository of reusable agent design patterns and other types of process modeling knowledge.

135.0,Included,included,A Hybrid Software Architecture Evaluation Method for FDD - An Agile Process Model,"The software development industry suffers from the delay in project completion time due to heavy documentation requirements of traditional process models. To overcome these delays, agile process models are getting a wide acceptance and popularity in the industry. The beauty of these models is light weight documentation and heavy intercommunications. Due to an emphasis of these models on rapid development, there is an ever increasing need of architecture evaluation. A single software architecture evaluation method (SAEM) capable of preserving the agility does not exist at the moment. In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid SAEM for feature driven development (FDD) agile process model. The proposed SAEM is hybrid of quality attribute workshop (QAW), architecture tradeoff analysis method (ATAM) and active review for intermediate designs (ARID).",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements in the context of agile methodologies, specifically within the Feature Driven Development (FDD) process.

391.0,Included,included,Agile management of uncertain requirements via generalizations: a case study,"A major justification for the agile class of software processes is that customer requirements often change substantially during development, with the result that developers must work with a ever-changing specification. The best way of dealing with this, it is claimed, is a process including adaptive and iterative steps allowing the code under development to change to meet an evolving requirement. In this paper, we use quantitative process data to argue that the deliberate development of an evolvable design, based upon extensions and variations to the requirements, and the generality derivable from the implemented system, may provide agility within a more traditional development, showing that the two concepts are interchangeable, to some extent. In doing so, the paper draws upon our joint work on evolvable systems, and upon a concept developed by one of us in the 1980's, ""The Contraction of Generality"", to illustrate the alternatives.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements in agile methodologies by exploring how evolvable design and generalizations can provide agility in traditional development processes.

537.0,Included,included,An integrated approach for requirement selection and scheduling in software release planning,"It is essential for product software companies to decide which requirements should be included in the next release and to make an appropriate time plan of the development project. Compared to the extensive research done on requirement selection, very little research has been performed on time scheduling. In this paper, we introduce two integer linear programming models that integrate time scheduling into software release planning. Given the resource and precedence constraints, our first model provides a schedule for developing the requirements such that the project duration is minimized. Our second model combines requirement selection and scheduling, so that it not only maximizes revenues but also simultaneously calculates an on-time-delivery project schedule. Since requirement dependencies are essential for scheduling the development process, we present a more detailed analysis of these dependencies. Furthermore, we present two mechanisms that facilitate dynamic adaptation for over-estimation or under-estimation of revenues or processing time, one of which includes the Scrum methodology. Finally, several simulations based on real-life data are performed. The results of these simulations indicate that requirement dependency can significantly influence the requirement selection and the corresponding project plan. Moreover, the model for combined requirement selection and scheduling outperforms the sequential selection and scheduling approach in terms of efficiency and on-time delivery.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements in the context of agile methodologies, specifically mentioning the integration of Scrum methodology in dynamic adaptation mechanisms.

1641.0,Included,included,Managing agile project requirements with storytest-driven development,"Agile project teams aim to include both business and development personnel, emphasizing direct communication over written requirements documents. Rather than trying to understand all of a system's detailed requirements before development, they carry out high-level release planning and then drive small development increments in cycles of one or two weeks. Doing so avoids many of the potential problems in traditional, phased software development approaches and accepts that changes are inevitable. Storytest-driven development brings requirements and automated testing ideas and practices together to support this agile process. The author describes this development approach and how its concrete examples can clarify and communicate business rules, aid agile team discussions, and facilitate team members' understanding of the concepts at the heart of the business needs.

1833.0,Included,included,Perceived productivity threats in large agile development projects,"Applying agile methodology in large software development projects introduces many challenges. For example, one may expect that the combination of autonomous teams and the necessity for an overall organizational control structure may lead to conflicts, and one may expect that Agile's informal means of knowledge sharing breaks down as the number of project participants increases. Such issues may in turn compromise the project's productivity. In order to better understand potential threats to productivity in large agile development projects, we conducted repertory grid interviews with 13 project members on their perceptions of threats to productivity. The project was a large software development project consisting of 11 Scrum teams from three different subcontractors. The repertory grid sessions produced 100 issues, which were content analyzed into 10 main problem areas: (1) Restraints on collaboration due to contracts, ownership, and culture, (2) Architectural and technical qualities are given low priority, (3) Conflicts between organizational control and flexibility, (4) Volatile and late requirements from external parties, (5) Lack of a shared vision for the end product, (6) Limited dissemination of functional knowledge, (7) Excessive dependencies within the system, (8) Overloading of key personnel, (9) Difficulties in maintaining well-functioning technical environments, (10) Difficulties in coordinating test and deployment with external parties. Using critical-case reasoning, we claim that projects deploying agile practices in projects with less favorable conditions than those enjoyed in the current project, and that are larger and more complex, are likely to face similar challenges.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software project requirements in the context of agile methodologies (specifically Scrum), focusing on perceived productivity threats in large-scale agile projects.

149.0,Included,included,A literature review of agile practices and their effects in scientific software development,"The nature of scientific research and the development of scientific software have similarities with processes that follow the agile manifesto: responsiveness to change and collaboration are of the utmost importance. But how well do current scientific software development processes match the practices found in agile development methods, and what are the effects of using agile practices in such processes? In order to investigate this, we conduct a literature review, focusing on evaluating the agility present in a selection of scientific software projects. Both projects with intentionally agile practices and projects with a certain degree of agile elements are taken into consideration. In the agility assessment, we define and utilize an agile mapping chart. The elements of the mapping chart are based on Scrum and XP, thus covering two of the most prominent agile reference models. We compared the findings of the literature review to results of a previously conducted survey. The comparison indicates that scientific software development projects adopting agile practices perceive their testing to be better than average. No difference to average projects was perceived regarding requirements-related activities. Future work includes an in-depth case study to further investigate the existence and impact of agility in three large scientific software projects, ultimately aiming at a better understanding of the particularities involved in developing scientific software.

However, designing for SOA can be challenging; there are issues involving the granularity of the cooperating services, problems with proprietary data models being exchanged, and there are no currently accepted conventions for describing a service or its interactions at an abstract level.

1032.0,Excluded,ec3,Development of auxiliary functions: should you be agile? an empirical assessment of pair programming and test-first programming,"A considerable part of software systems is comprised of functions that support the main modules, such as array or string manipulation and basic math computation. These auxiliary functions are usually considered less complex, and thus tend to receive less attention from developers. However, failures in these functions might propagate to more critical modules, thereby affecting the system's overall reliability. Given the complementary role of auxiliary functions, a question that arises is whether agile practices, such as pair programming and test-first programming, can improve their correctness without affecting time-to-market. This paper presents an empirical assessment comparing the application of these agile practices with more traditional approaches. Our study comprises independent experiments of pair versus solo programming, and test-first versus test-last programming. The first study involved 85 novice programmers who applied both traditional and agile approaches in the development of six auxiliary functions within three different domains. Our results suggest that the agile practices might bring benefits in this context. In particular, pair programmers delivered correct implementations much more often, and test-first programming encouraged the production of larger and higher coverage test sets. On the downside, the main experiment showed that both practices significantly increase total development time. A replication of the test-first experiment with professional developers shows similar results.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements in the context of agile methodologies (pair programming and test-first programming) by empirically assessing their impact on the correctness and development time of auxiliary functions.

For this reason, many companies have difficulties to choose appropriate tools to support their Agile process. One such company is the Swedish telecommunications giant Ericsson. To account for this lack of data, Ericsson commissioned us to conduct an independent survey focusing on the tool usage and needs as experienced by the Agile software community today. In this paper, we report on the results of our survey. The survey covers 121 responses from 120 different companies coming from 35 different countries. Our results show that the most satisfactory tool aspect is ease of use, whereas the least satisfactory one is lack of integration with other systems. Finally, our results provide a list of features that are most desired by the software companies today.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements in software projects using agile methodologies (IC1), is based on a primary study (IC4), and covers real-world tool usage and needs from industry (IC2).

With this contract, applications know what to expect of one another and this provides a solid foundation for integration. The resulting business process improvements translate directly into saved costs and new business opportunities. However, these workflow improvements typically come to a grinding halt whenever real-time input from consumers is required since there is currently no way to effectively construct the same sort of contract for spontaneous person-tomachine interactions as Web Services provides for machine-to-machine interaction. The consumer-to-machine link is characterised by reliability, availability, trust and conformance to message syntax all being in unbearable deficit … and all of that deficit being due to the user ‘component’ rather than the machine! For this reason, the solution designer will typically consider the user to be effectively unavailable and ‘park’ the workflow in a suitable state pending user intervention at some later date. If a mechanism were available to transform the user into a reliable, highly available, trusted component of the overall workflow system which always rendered its requests/responses in machine-readable form to an agreed syntax then that ‘component’ (the user) could be included in automated processes directly. This integration of the user into the workflow would have far-reaching impact on the way systems are designed and operated, providing the user with much greater control of service delivery and improving the overall service experience.This paper describes a prototype system and how the operator of such a system can support users employing a multitude of devices connected over various networks and offer to third parties a facility whereby they can very easily conduct structured interactions with those users in real time, on the device of their preference, without them requiring any knowledge of those users’ devices, addresses, networks, presence or device preferences.

In this paper, we propose a decomposition-based approach for service composition, in which the utility of a composite service can be computed from the utilities of component services and the constraints of component services can be derived from the constraints of the composite service. Thus, with our approach, it is possible to independently manage the selection of each component service, leading to more scalability and more flexibility for service composition in a dynamic environment.

We reported in a previous work a stress testing methodology to detect performance-related Real-Time (RT) faults in DRTSâ€™s based on the design \{UML\} model of a System Under Test (SUT). The stress methodology aimed at increasing the chances of \{RT\} failures (violations in \{RT\} constraints). Objective After stress testing a \{SUT\} and finding \{RT\} faults, an important immediate question is how to fix (debug) those \{RT\} faults and prevent the same \{RT\} violations in the future and after deployment. If appropriate solutions to this challenge cannot be found, stress testing and its findings (detection of \{RT\} faults) will be of no or little use to the quality assurance goals of the development team. Method To move towards systematically solving performance-related problems causing \{RT\} faults, we develop a customized version of the standard Software Performance Engineering process and conduct an experiment on a DRTS. The process is iteratively applied to a SUT, while results from stress testing reveal that there are still scenarios in which \{RT\} constraints are violated. Results Application of the performance engineering paradigm in this context on a real \{DRTS\} enables systematic analysis of performance-related defects and their fixations.

Objective This paper provides an in-depth discussion of the applicability and implications of open innovation in an agile environment. Method We draw on two illustrative cases from industry. Results We highlight some distinct problems that arose when two project teams tried to combine agile and open innovation principles. For example, openness is often compromised by a perceived competitive element and lack of transparency between business units. In addition, minimal documentation often reduce effective knowledge transfer while the use of short iterations, stand-up meetings and presence of on-site customer reduce the amount of time for sharing ideas outside the team.

In this paper, we propose a Software Maintenance Effort Estimation Model (SMEEM) for software maintenance estimation. The \{SMEEM\} technique uses story points to calculate the volume of maintenance and value adjustment factors that are affecting story points for effort estimation. The proposed model will be illustrated with various types of maintenance projects. The model generates accurate and effective results as compared to other software maintenance effort estimation models. This model is applicable only for agile and extreme programming based maintenance environment.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software maintenance effort estimation using agile methodologies, specifically extreme programming, which aligns with IC1. It is a primary study that proposes a new model (SMEEM) based on story points and value adjustment factors, satisfying IC4. The study is not written in a non-English language (EC1), does not deal with teaching agile methods (EC6), does not involve tertiary or meta-analysis (EC5), and addresses at least one agile methodology (EC7). It also answers research questions related to effort estimation in maintenance contexts (EC9). No exclusion criteria are violated, and all inclusion criteria are met."
2011.0,Excluded,ec7,Reducing complexity using an interaction room: an experience report,"Large-scale information system evolution projects often place high demands on both business and technical stakeholders' cognitive and communication skills. Especially if the need for evolution is not confined to a particular feature, but affects the whole value chain, finding dependencies and interrelationships between processes and components is challenging as it requires cross-departmental understanding. These issues can be even more challenging for management stakeholders who need to make high-level and far-reaching decisions on implementation strategies despite not being deeply involved in the technical details. One of the main problems in such projects is that the stakeholders who have expert knowledge typically have only little methodical experience, while the method experts lack the business experience. In this paper, we report on experiences and lessons from a large systems evolution project in a German insurance company, where we applied a new approach -- the so-called ""Interaction Room"" -- to improve stakeholders' understanding of the project's risks and dependencies in a pragmatic way, without overwhelming them with a heavyweight analysis method.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements as it focuses on improving stakeholder understanding of project risks and dependencies through an 'Interaction Room' approach, rather than on software requirements in agile projects. This violates Exclusion Criterion EC3."
116.0,Excluded,ec3,A framework for assessing poka-yoke devices,"This study introduces a framework for assessing poka-yoke devices (PD), encompassing both those designed for quality control (referred to as quality PD) and those designed to control hazards to health and safety at work (referred to as safety PD). The framework assesses the processes of the design, operation and maintenance of PD, rather than the outcomes of these processes. The development of the framework involved three stages: (a) defining 15 attributes of PD, identifying those that provide fail-safe characteristics and those that inform best practices in design, implementation and maintenance; (b) defining what the set of evidence and what the sources of evidence should be for assessing the existence of each attribute; the sources include documents, interviews, observations and a meeting to discuss the results of the assessment with company representatives; and (c) defining a scoring system to express the results of the assessment. The application of the framework is illustrated by means of assessing four PD; two of them being concerned with quality and two with safety.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements or agile methodologies, violating Exclusion Criterion EC3 and EC7. It focuses on poka-yoke devices in quality control and safety, which are unrelated to software project requirements or agile practices."
885.0,Excluded,ec3,Clearing the RF smog: making 802.11n robust to cross-technology interference,"Recent studies show that high-power cross-technology interference is becoming a major problem in today's 802.11 networks. Devices like baby monitors and cordless phones can cause a wireless LAN to lose connectivity. The existing approach for dealing with such high-power interferers makes the 802.11 network switch to a different channel; yet the ISM band is becoming increasingly crowded with diverse technologies, and hence many 802.11 access points may not find an interference-free channel.This paper presents TIMO, a MIMO design that enables 802.11n to communicate in the presence of high-power cross-technology interference. Unlike existing MIMO designs, however, which require all concurrent transmissions to belong to the same technology, TIMO can exploit MIMO capabilities to decode in the presence of a signal from a different technology, hence enabling diverse technologies to share the same frequency band. We implement a prototype of TIMO in GNURadio-USRP2 and show that it enables 802.11n to communicate in the presence of interference from baby monitors, cordless phones, and microwave ovens, transforming scenarios with a complete loss of connectivity to operational networks.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements in software projects, as it focuses on wireless network interference and MIMO design in 802.11n technology, which falls under hardware and communication engineering.

The customer's explicit responsibilities are to drive the project, providing project requirements (user stories) and quality control (acceptance testing): unfortunately the customer must also shoulder a number of implicit responsibilities including liaison with external project stakeholders, especially project funders, clients, and end users, while maintaining the trust of both the development team and the wider business. In this paper, we report on a series of case studies of the customer role in XP projects. We have found that customers have a pressured and stressful role, leading to issues of sustainability.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software project requirements in the context of extreme programming (XP), a specific agile methodology, through case studies (qualitative research).

86.0,Included,included,A comparison of model-based and judgment-based release planning in incremental software projects,"Numerous factors are involved when deciding when to implement which features in incremental software development. To facilitate a rational and efficient planning process, release planning models make such factors explicit and compute release plan alternatives according to optimization principles. However, experience suggests that industrial use of such models is limited. To investigate the feasibility of model and tool support, we compared input factors assumed by release planning models with factors considered by expert planners. The former factors were cataloged by systematically surveying release planning models, while the latter were elicited through repertory grid interviews in three software organizations. The findings indicate a substantial overlap between the two approaches. However, a detailed analysis reveals that models focus on only select parts of a possibly larger space of relevant planning factors. Three concrete areas of mismatch were identified: (1) continuously evolving requirements and specifications, (2) continuously changing prioritization criteria, and (3) authority-based decision processes. With these results in mind, models, tools and guidelines can be adjusted to address better real-life development processes.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software project requirements in the context of release planning using agile methodologies, specifically focusing on incremental software development.

138.0,Included,included,A knowledge-based framework for extracting components in agile systems development,"Considerable strides have been made in the use of components in software development. Many proprietary enterprise resource planning (ERP) software environments use modular components to develop and customize “best practices” to meet a specific organizational need. In agile application development, many developers and users are asked to design systems in a short period of time. These applications may use components that are embedded in software repositories. The challenge then is how to select the right software components (data and procedures) to meet an application requirement. Although experienced developers may select and customize components to meet the needs of an application, such expertise may not be available to other applications. This paper presents a knowledge-based framework to select and customize software components and demonstrates its value in deriving quality specifications, even when the developers are relatively inexperienced.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements in agile systems development by proposing a knowledge-based framework for selecting and customizing software components, which directly relates to agile methodologies.

1359.0,Excluded,ec3,History of a Large Test Automation Project Using Selenium,"In 2007 I started work as a tester for a company called Socialtext. When I joined the company there was already a Selenium-based test framework in place, but there were only a couple of automated test cases created; we had about 400 test steps, or individual assertions about the behavior of the application. When I left Socialtext two years later, we had just surpassed 10,000 test steps in the main set of regression tests. We also had browser-specific test sets in place, an automated test case for visually checking the application, and a Continuous-Integration-like script that ran all day and all night against the latest version of the code. At about 4000 test steps, regression bugs released to production dropped essentially to zero. The other 6000 test steps covered ongoing new features in the project, and more robust testing of the older application functions. This report discusses how I helped grow this system, and the things we learned along the way that helped it be such a successful ongoing project. The report covers initial conditions and test design; discusses issues in application feature coverage; how and when to grow the system quickly; a couple of test design smells that caused us problems along the way; how we treat Continuous Integration in a system like this; and how we coped when significant parts of the User Interface were completely re-engineered.",EXCLUDED,"The article is a personal account and narrative report of a test automation project using Selenium, not a study that addresses software requirements in the context of agile methodologies. It does not explicitly address or analyze any agile methodology (EC7), nor does it present a research study with defined research questions (EC9). Additionally, it lacks a structured research design (qualitative or quantitative) and does not meet the inclusion criteria for addressing software requirements using agile methodologies. Therefore, it is excluded due to failing to address at least one agile methodology (EC7) and failing to answer at least one research question (EC9)."
