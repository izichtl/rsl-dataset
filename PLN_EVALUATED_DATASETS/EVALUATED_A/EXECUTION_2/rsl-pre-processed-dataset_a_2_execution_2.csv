1543.0,Excluded,ec3,Investigating Daily Team Meetings in Agile Software Projects,"An increasing amount of time is being spent at organizational meetings. One common type of meeting in software projects is the daily team meeting, which is the most important forum for coordinating and planning daily work. To better understand how software teams make decisions, communicate, and coordinate their work, we must uncover the micro-level interaction processes among the team members at these meetings. We analyzed transcriptions of eight daily meetings from two software development teams. The agile literature states that the daily meeting should focus on answering questions such as ""What have I done? What will be done? What obstacles are in my way?"" However, on average, only 24% of each of the meetings that we studied focused on this task. We found that 35% of the meeting was spent on elaborating problem issues and discussing possible solutions. Very little time was used for coordinating tasks. Our results indicate that many project decisions are made in daily team meetings and that this quick decision making requires team members to be experts. These experts need to have a shared understanding of who is responsible for what and of the information and requirements needed to solve the tasks.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software project requirements in the context of agile methodologies, specifically focusing on daily team meetings.

The 620 papers examined contained 18,066 instances of these words. The words identified were divided into `general terms' for models (505), `special names' for models (215) and names for the `nature and characteristics' of models and modelling (120). The large numbers are a clear indicator of the overall importance which the model has as a dominant concept and as a still proliferating artifact in the practice of those participating in the series. The three groups of names represent social conventions adopted for communication and continuity; the third provides a pragmatically rather than theoretically based overview of the factors affecting models and modelling. The conclusions suggest questions that may improve general practice and form the basis of more specific model declaration.",EXCLUDED,"The study is a tertiary analysis of published conference papers, focusing on word usage and frequency rather than addressing software requirements in agile methodologies.

125.0,Excluded,ec3,A genetic algorithm approach for solving the daily photograph selection problem of the \{SPOT5\} satellite,"This article addresses the combinatorial optimization problem of managing earth observation satellites (EOSs) such as the French SPOT5, which is concerned with selecting on each day a subset of a set of candidate photographs. The problem has a significant economic importance due to its high initial investment cost that exists in these instruments and its solution difficulty resulting from the large solution space, making it an attractive research area. This article proposes a genetic algorithm (GA) for solving the \{SPOT5\} selection problem using a new genome representation for maximizing not only a single objective as profit but a multi-criteria objective that includes the number of acquired photographs. Test results of our proposed \{GA\} show that it finds optimal solutions effectively for moderate size problems and obtains better results for two large benchmark instances coded 1403 and 1504 in the literature. Also, we verify the result that the best known value in the literature for problem coded 1401 is an optimal value.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements or agile methodologies, violating Exclusion Criteria EC3 and EC7.

1629.0,Included,included,Making Metaphors that Matter,"The system metaphor was proposed in Extreme Programming as a lightweight alternative to more rigorous architecture practices, but many teams have trouble using metaphors effectively to improve team communication or evaluate a system's architecture. This is no surprise as few agile teams have had training in architecture practices let alone in how to create metaphors. In our experience this does not invalidate the metaphor, but rather shows that more guidance is needed in the proper use of metaphors.

1164.0,Excluded,ec3,Ethical decision making in technology development: a case study of participation in a large-scale information systems development project,"Advanced systems engineering has traditionally paid little attention to ethical concerns relative to other technical and non-technical issues. This is particularly evident in systems analysis, design, and development methodologies. This paper asks if it is possible that the lack of emphasis upon ethical considerations in development methodologies can result in the failure of advanced technology development projects? In order to explore this contention, the paper sets out the findings of a case study of a large-scale advanced technology project in a multinational engineering company involving the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system. The research examined the extent to which ethical issues emerged in the project and assesses the impact of ethical considerations upon the technology development process and its outcomes. Evidence is presented which shows how ethical concerns clearly impacted upon the outcome of the project, supporting the contention that ethics was a success factor in the case presented. However, it was also clear that the kinds of ethical considerations that emerged were highly complex, and associated with an “ethics of care”. The findings suggested that researchers should examine the potential of an “ethics of care” as a way of complimenting the “ethics of rights” currently dominant within engineering ethics.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements or agile methodologies, violating Exclusion Criterion EC7.

1202.0,Included,included,Experiences integrating sophisticated user experience design practices into agile processes,"Most significant software processes involve a wide range of disciplines, from programming to testing, and from documentation to database development. Unfortunately, agile processes are typically presented from the point of view of programmers, with the other disciplines often left feeling excluded and disenfranchised. One such discipline is that of user experience design (often abbreviated UED), a discipline encompassing several key specialties including user research, interface design, visual design and usability testing. UED activities span the full lifecycle of product development from early requirements analysis to construction and testing, spanning both large scale system issues and detailed components, with its work products forming key inputs and deliverables of many development activities. In this experience report, we discuss the author's coaching experiences integrating sophisticated UED practices into the agile process initiatives of several organizations. His background is initially that of a programmer and later that of an agile process coach, and we'll explore his journey understanding UED practices and how they map to popular agile processes, mainly Scrum in ""agile software development with Scrum"" by K. Schwaber and M. Beedle (2002) and extreme programming in ""extreme programming explained: embrace change"" by K. Beck (2000).

While a few linguistic techniques exist that extract or validate structured information from unstructured natural language use case, they often cannot be extended beyond their primary language. Extending linguistic analysis and automated validation capabilities across multiple languages is necessary not only for widespread industrial adoption but it helps in analyzing a collection of multilingual use cases (quite frequent in multi-national projects) that need to be aggregated.

863.0,Included,included,Chapter 9 - Bridging User Stories and Software Architecture: A Tailored Scrum for Agile Architecting,"Abstract Agile architecting is a key issue to scale agile to develop large software systems. This chapter describes a set of mechanisms that make agile architecting feasible. These mechanisms are smoothly integrated in a tailored Scrum for agile architecting by (1) defining product requirements in terms of features by using feature pools and feature trees to provide the portfolio and roadmap visions of a product, (2) designing highly flexible architecture called working architecture, (3) bridging user stories and software architecture through features and design decisions as traceability mechanisms, and (4) systematically assisting agile practitioners by conducting change impact analysis of features through various iterations of the agile process. This tailored Scrum for agile architecting has been successfully put into practice to develop several projects, which have been deployed in a software factory set up in collaboration between the Technical University of Madrid (UPM) and the company Indra. In this chapter, one of these projects is used to illustrate how this tailored Scrum has been applied and how it can be adopted.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements in agile methodologies (specifically through feature pools, feature trees, and traceability mechanisms), is written in English, is not a draft or abstract, does not deal with teaching agile methods, does not involve a meta-analysis or tertiary study, and addresses at least one agile methodology (Scrum).

Market forces caused new technology innovations, and traditional outsourcing strategies failed to deliver on the new vision. The decision to develop these new product capabilities in-house created the need for software competency that didn't currently exist. Cost of software was historically considered “free” because it was very simple and ROI was far less than a year. Now, software is driving many business decisions and strategies. And today the software group has about 40 people. Starting a software competency in an existing business with material non-software businesses is not straightforward. Sustaining this competency requires successfully addressing challenges with the entire organization and is a long-term effort.

145.0,Included,included,A layer-based method for rapid software development,"A layer-based method for rapid software development is presented in this paper. It follows the guidelines suggested by Extreme Programming (XP) that require highly expressive programming languages (i.e., Java) and \{CASE\} tools. As in XP, this method addresses rapid software development for small- or medium-sized projects. Further, for effective guidance on the development, it directs the construction of system components by imposing an architecture-based concept of layered specification and construction of these components through its activities. Since the method follows the guidelines suggested by \{XP\} and supports effective guidance by a layered development of architectural components, team productivities can be greatly enhanced with less (but effective) overheads on specification work. The method uses \{UML\} and Petri nets as its modeling tool; for illustration, an example application is presented that specifies and directs the development of a software system with business-oriented Internet services.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements in agile methodologies (specifically Extreme Programming, XP), as it presents a layer-based method for rapid software development that follows XP guidelines.

1972.0,Included,included,Quality Attribute Driven Agile Development,"Agile development methods are being recognized as popular and efficient approaches to the development of software systems that have features such as a short delivery period and unclear requirements. They emphasize customer satisfaction, fast response to changes, and release in less time. According to a recent survey, SCRUM is one of the most popular methods that are currently being used. Some backlogs, especially high priority backlogs that are functional requirements of customers, are developed repeatedly at each sprint period. Despite the known advantages of SCRUM, however, its backlogs focus only on functional features. Thus, it is difficult to effectively reflect the softwares quality attributes. As known, the failure of a software project is caused by the non-satisfaction not of functional features but of quality attributes, such as performance, usability, and reliability. This paper introduces the ACRUM that is a quality attribute driven agile development method. The main characteristic of the proposed solution is that it is derived from values and practices of SCRUM to be compatible with the SCRUM process and to keep its agility intact. The effect of ACRUM was evaluated through an agile process evaluation checklist and applying it into a commercial project of Samsung Electronics. The results showed that ACRUM is more efficient than the legacy agile development process.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements in agile methodologies (specifically, quality attributes like performance, usability, and reliability) and proposes a new agile method (ACRUM) derived from SCRUM.

986.0,Included,included,Decision theoretic requirements prioritization: a two-step approach for sliding towards value realization,"Budget and schedule constraints limit the number of requirements that can be worked on for a software system and is thus necessary to select the most valuable requirements for implementation. However, selecting from a large number of requirements is a decision problem that requires negotiating with multiple stakeholders and satisficing their value propositions. In this paper I present a two-step value-based requirements prioritization approach based on TOPSIS, a decision analysis framework that tightly integrates decision theory with the process of requirements prioritization. In this two-step approach the software system is initially decomposed into high-level Minimal Marketable Features (MMFs) which the business stakeholders prioritize against business goals. Each individual MMF is further decomposed into low-level requirements/features that are primarily prioritized by the technical stakeholders. The priorities of the low-level requirements are influenced by the MMFs they belong to. This approach has been integrated into Winbook, a social-networking influenced collaborative requirements management framework and deployed for use by 10 real-client project teams for the Software Engineering project course at the University of Southern California in Fall 2012. This model allowed the clients and project teams to effectively gauge the importance of each MMF and low-level requirement and perform various sensitivity analyses and take value-informed decisions when selecting requirements for implementation.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements in the context of agile methodologies by proposing a value-based prioritization approach integrated into a collaborative requirements management framework.

While they are not immediately in the spirit of the agile philosophy, which advocates live dialogue over documentation and encourages small teams of developers to do the simplest thing possible to satisfy a requirement, there are some fundamental practices supported by these tools that play a role in more agile forms of software development. This paper examines the core requirements management needs that are common to software development of all flavors, at a high level, and describes a tool concept designed to bring lightweight requirements management to the agile (predominantly XP) context.

2286.0,Excluded,ec5,Static composition of refactorings,"The number of possible refactorings is unlimited, so no tool vendor will ever be able to provide custom refactorings for all specific user needs. Therefore, we propose a new kind of refactoring tools, which allow users to create, edit and compose required refactorings just like any other documents. The heart of such a refactoring editor is the ability to compose larger refactorings from existing ones. Computing the precondition of the composite refactoring from the preconditions of the composed refactorings is non-trivial since earlier transformations influence the truth of preconditions of later ones. The ability to calculate these effects without referring to a particular program to which the refactorings should be applied is called program-independent composition. It is the prerequisite for creating composite refactorings that are reusable on arbitrary programs. The main contribution of this paper is a formal model for automatic, program-independent composition of conditional program transformations. We show that conditional transformations, including refactorings, can be composed from a limited set of basic operations. Program-independent derivation of a precondition for the composite is based on the notion of â€œtransformation descriptionâ€�, which can be seen as a simplified, yet equally powerful, variant of Robertsâ€™ â€œpostconditionsâ€� (Practical analysis for refactoring, Ph.D. Thesis (1999)). Our approach simplifies the implementation of refactoring toolsâ€”only the basic operations and the ability for composition must be hard coded in a tool.

The challenge lies in the difficulty of analyzing and assessing the proneness to requirement changes across multiple versions, especially when the scale of requirements is large. In this paper, we define a series of metrics to characterize historic evolution information, and propose a novel method for predicting requirements that are likely to evolve in the future based on the metrics. We apply the prediction method to analyze the product updates history through a case study. The empirical results show that this method can provide a tradeoff solution that narrows down the scope of change analysis to a small set of requirements, but it still can retrieve nearly half of the future changes. The results indicate that the defined metrics are sensitive to the history of requirements evolution, and the prediction method can reach a valuable outcome for requirement engineers to balance their workload and risks.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements in the context of agile methodologies.

And even though product planning typically begins before significant engineering expenditure, the people who do the product planning are very rarely people who are trained in user-centered product design.

618.0,Excluded,ec3,Assessment methodology for software process improvement in small organizations,"Context Diagnosing processes in a small company requires process assessment practices which give qualitative and quantitative results; these should offer an overall view of the process capability. The purpose is to obtain relevant information about the running of processes, for use in their control and improvement. However, small organizations have some problems in running process assessment, due to their specific characteristics and limitations. Objective This paper presents a methodology for assessing software processes which assist the activity of software process diagnosis in small organizations. There is an attempt to address issues such as the fact that: (i) process assessment is expensive and typically requires major company resources and (ii) many light assessment methods do not provide information that is detailed enough for diagnosing and improving processes. Method To achieve all this, the \{METvalCOMPETISOFT\} assessment methodology was developed. This methodology: (i) incorporates the strategy of internal assessments known as rapid assessment, meaning that these assessments do not take up too much time or use an excessive quantity of resources, nor are they too rigorous and (ii) meets all the requirements described in the literature for an assessment proposal which is customized to the typical features of small companies. Results This paper also describes the experience of the application of this methodology in eight small software organizations that took part in the \{COMPETISOFT\} project. The results obtained show that this approach allows us to obtain reliable information about the strengths and weaknesses of software processes, along with information to companies on opportunities for improvement. Conclusion The assessment methodology proposed sets out the elements needed to assist with diagnosing the process in small organizations step-by-step while seeking to make its application economically feasible in terms of resources and time.

From a metaphorical point of view, technology is more and more part of ourselves and behaves like a symbiont. From the time human and technologies start to form coherent and linked units, the relation between human, technology and organization can be apprehended according to a symbiotic approach which considers that human and technologies are connected by strong dependent relationships.

The chapter suggests that these architectural elements should be identified in each project via a risk-based approach. These resulting architecture elements can then be used by a distributed low-cost delivery organization to reduce rework within the agile software development process and accelerate delivery by maximizing the overall delivery pipeline.

The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is the foundation on which the architecture, design, and implementation of a trading/investment system are built. While prototypes have been created for most features, the team will encounter and address them one by one in an iterative fashion. An \{SRS\} for a trading/investment system consists of the combined, ordered, and linked descriptions and documents, and prototypes created in earlier stages, including data dictionary, data maps and data flow maps, \{GUI\} requirements, error handling maps, and report generation maps. An iteration plan lays out the designâ€“buildâ€“test scenario for each piece of the system, tackling the features with the highest business priority and risk first. The team leader uses timeboxed iteration cycles to track progress of completed tasks and features as development progresses and at each iteration planning meeting, the development team breaks down features into tasks and assigns tasks to team members. When team members complete tasks, they erase them or cross them out. During iteration meetings, the team should also make estimates for computer capacity, server and database use, and network capacity, which should all be documented as they impact departments and personnel external to the development team. The team should also be cognizant of risks to external dependencies, such as delays caused by other departments or vendors. The quickest way to shorten a software development schedule is to buy components or reuse existing software.

In the field of system and acceptance testing requirements are the basis for all activities. Although, requirements are often not close to testing. To overcome this we introduced the Timed Usage Model (TUM) as a formal representation of requirements specification. During the creation of the model the requirements are analyzed and brought into an unambiguous and formal representation. Traceability is achieved, as each path in the model must be based upon a requirement. The formulation of the requirements in form of an unambiguous model clarifies the requirements and helps to detect design errors. During the creation of the model omissions and flaws in the requirements are discovered. The model serves as a communication medium when functionality responsibles are involved to clarify these aspects.

The team sought to create a convention for representing agile stories which could capture the complexities of the system requirements without burdening the team with unneeded documentation. They developed eight different ways to represent a story. The core representation of the approach was called a HyperEpic, a structured collection of closely-related HyperStories.
