1655.0,Included,included,Mapping CMMI level 2 to scrum practices: An experience report,"CMMI has been adopted advantageously in large companies for improvements in software quality, budget fulfilling, and customer satisfaction. However SPI strategies based on CMMI-DEV require heavy software development processes and large investments in terms of cost and time that medium/small companies do not deal with. The so-called light software development processes, such as Agile Software Development (ASD), deal with these challenges. ASD welcomes changing requirements and stresses the importance of adaptive planning, simplicity and continuous delivery of valuable software by short time-framed iterations. ASD is becoming convenient in a more and more global, and changing software market. It would be greatly useful to be able to introduce agile methods such as Scrum in compliance with CMMI process model. This paper intends to increase the understanding of the relationship between ASD and CMMI-DEV reporting empirical results that confirm theoretical comparisons between ASD practices and CMMI level2.

The goal of this research was to increase the understanding of the impact of using the Extreme Programming process, an Agile modeling approach, to the development effort of a biosecurity telehealth project. Overall, the research indicates that Extreme Programming is an effective methodology to develop health care applications.

In many of these projects the rather simple requirements engineering of XP (customers write story cards) has proved suitable. But today we are more often faced with complex application domains in which the classical XP techniques will not suffice. The tutorial shows how to adapt extreme programming to complex application domains and to demanding development tasks. We focus mainly on the requirements engineering part and show how to enhance XP with interviews, scenarios and system visions. We also integrate the management perspective into the ""planning game"" reconciling this perspective to users' needs.

2583.0,Included,included,Tool-supported process analysis and design for the development of multi-agent systems,"This paper introduces a methodology for the development of multi-agent systems, in particular multi-agent systems that optimize the collaboration of distributed work groups like clinical departments. A major difficulty with such systems is requirements elicitation, because intimate knowledge of the work processes is needed to identify the potential agent application scenarios. In the face of uncertain requirements, our methodology exploits some ideas from agile software development approaches such as Extreme Programming, namely the values of collaboration with domain experts and of human creativity driven by rapid feedback. We support collaboration by means of a tool-supported modeling approach that allows one to capture existing and agentified processes in a format that is sufficiently simple to be understood and maintained by domain experts. These process models can be automatically synchronized with executable agent source code, so that rapid feedback is ensured. We support creativity by means of a searchable repository of reusable agent design patterns and other types of process modeling knowledge.

135.0,Included,included,A Hybrid Software Architecture Evaluation Method for FDD - An Agile Process Model,"The software development industry suffers from the delay in project completion time due to heavy documentation requirements of traditional process models. To overcome these delays, agile process models are getting a wide acceptance and popularity in the industry. The beauty of these models is light weight documentation and heavy intercommunications. Due to an emphasis of these models on rapid development, there is an ever increasing need of architecture evaluation. A single software architecture evaluation method (SAEM) capable of preserving the agility does not exist at the moment. In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid SAEM for feature driven development (FDD) agile process model. The proposed SAEM is hybrid of quality attribute workshop (QAW), architecture tradeoff analysis method (ATAM) and active review for intermediate designs (ARID).",INCLUDED,"The article addresses requirements in software projects using agile methodologies (IC1), is a study from industry or academia (IC2), and is a primary study (IC4).

391.0,Included,included,Agile management of uncertain requirements via generalizations: a case study,"A major justification for the agile class of software processes is that customer requirements often change substantially during development, with the result that developers must work with a ever-changing specification. The best way of dealing with this, it is claimed, is a process including adaptive and iterative steps allowing the code under development to change to meet an evolving requirement. In this paper, we use quantitative process data to argue that the deliberate development of an evolvable design, based upon extensions and variations to the requirements, and the generality derivable from the implemented system, may provide agility within a more traditional development, showing that the two concepts are interchangeable, to some extent. In doing so, the paper draws upon our joint work on evolvable systems, and upon a concept developed by one of us in the 1980's, ""The Contraction of Generality"", to illustrate the alternatives.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses requirements in software projects using agile methodologies (IC1).

537.0,Included,included,An integrated approach for requirement selection and scheduling in software release planning,"It is essential for product software companies to decide which requirements should be included in the next release and to make an appropriate time plan of the development project. Compared to the extensive research done on requirement selection, very little research has been performed on time scheduling. In this paper, we introduce two integer linear programming models that integrate time scheduling into software release planning. Given the resource and precedence constraints, our first model provides a schedule for developing the requirements such that the project duration is minimized. Our second model combines requirement selection and scheduling, so that it not only maximizes revenues but also simultaneously calculates an on-time-delivery project schedule. Since requirement dependencies are essential for scheduling the development process, we present a more detailed analysis of these dependencies. Furthermore, we present two mechanisms that facilitate dynamic adaptation for over-estimation or under-estimation of revenues or processing time, one of which includes the Scrum methodology. Finally, several simulations based on real-life data are performed. The results of these simulations indicate that requirement dependency can significantly influence the requirement selection and the corresponding project plan. Moreover, the model for combined requirement selection and scheduling outperforms the sequential selection and scheduling approach in terms of efficiency and on-time delivery.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses requirements in software projects using agile methodologies (IC1), is a study from industry or academia (IC2), and employs quantitative research through simulations (IC3) and a primary study (IC4).

1641.0,Included,included,Managing agile project requirements with storytest-driven development,"Agile project teams aim to include both business and development personnel, emphasizing direct communication over written requirements documents. Rather than trying to understand all of a system's detailed requirements before development, they carry out high-level release planning and then drive small development increments in cycles of one or two weeks. Doing so avoids many of the potential problems in traditional, phased software development approaches and accepts that changes are inevitable. Storytest-driven development brings requirements and automated testing ideas and practices together to support this agile process. The author describes this development approach and how its concrete examples can clarify and communicate business rules, aid agile team discussions, and facilitate team members' understanding of the concepts at the heart of the business needs. Such examples are executable, serving a secondary role as automated tests.

1833.0,Included,included,Perceived productivity threats in large agile development projects,"Applying agile methodology in large software development projects introduces many challenges. For example, one may expect that the combination of autonomous teams and the necessity for an overall organizational control structure may lead to conflicts, and one may expect that Agile's informal means of knowledge sharing breaks down as the number of project participants increases. Such issues may in turn compromise the project's productivity. In order to better understand potential threats to productivity in large agile development projects, we conducted repertory grid interviews with 13 project members on their perceptions of threats to productivity. The project was a large software development project consisting of 11 Scrum teams from three different subcontractors. The repertory grid sessions produced 100 issues, which were content analyzed into 10 main problem areas: (1) Restraints on collaboration due to contracts, ownership, and culture, (2) Architectural and technical qualities are given low priority, (3) Conflicts between organizational control and flexibility, (4) Volatile and late requirements from external parties, (5) Lack of a shared vision for the end product, (6) Limited dissemination of functional knowledge, (7) Excessive dependencies within the system, (8) Overloading of key personnel, (9) Difficulties in maintaining well-functioning technical environments, (10) Difficulties in coordinating test and deployment with external parties. Using critical-case reasoning, we claim that projects deploying agile practices in projects with less favorable conditions than those enjoyed in the current project, and that are larger and more complex, are likely to face similar challenges.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses requirements in software projects using agile methodologies (IC1), is a study from industry or academia (IC2), and uses qualitative research methods (IC3) by utilizing repertory grid interviews.

We present a cross-discipline user interface design lifecycle that integrates SE and HCI under the umbrella of agile development.

149.0,Included,included,A literature review of agile practices and their effects in scientific software development,"The nature of scientific research and the development of scientific software have similarities with processes that follow the agile manifesto: responsiveness to change and collaboration are of the utmost importance. But how well do current scientific software development processes match the practices found in agile development methods, and what are the effects of using agile practices in such processes? In order to investigate this, we conduct a literature review, focusing on evaluating the agility present in a selection of scientific software projects. Both projects with intentionally agile practices and projects with a certain degree of agile elements are taken into consideration. In the agility assessment, we define and utilize an agile mapping chart. The elements of the mapping chart are based on Scrum and XP, thus covering two of the most prominent agile reference models. We compared the findings of the literature review to results of a previously conducted survey. The comparison indicates that scientific software development projects adopting agile practices perceive their testing to be better than average. No difference to average projects was perceived regarding requirements-related activities. Future work includes an in-depth case study to further investigate the existence and impact of agility in three large scientific software projects, ultimately aiming at a better understanding of the particularities involved in developing scientific software.

However, designing for SOA can be challenging; there are issues involving the granularity of the cooperating services, problems with proprietary data models being exchanged, and there are no currently accepted conventions for describing a service or its interactions at an abstract level. This paper gives an overview of the Service Responsibility and Interaction Design Method (SRI-DM), an agile approach for engineering a Web Service design based on capturing a scenario as a use-case, factoring this into a set of Service Responsibility and Collaboration Cards, and constructing a Sequence diagram illustrating their interactions in fulfilling the scenario. Through two case studies the paper shows how using SRI-DM can expose many of the problems of over-engineering SOA and help to create simpler, more pragmatic web service designs.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses requirements in software projects using agile methodologies (IC1), is a study from industry or academia (IC2), and is a primary study employing qualitative and quantitative research (IC3 & IC4).

1032.0,Excluded,ec3,Development of auxiliary functions: should you be agile? an empirical assessment of pair programming and test-first programming,"A considerable part of software systems is comprised of functions that support the main modules, such as array or string manipulation and basic math computation. These auxiliary functions are usually considered less complex, and thus tend to receive less attention from developers. However, failures in these functions might propagate to more critical modules, thereby affecting the system's overall reliability. Given the complementary role of auxiliary functions, a question that arises is whether agile practices, such as pair programming and test-first programming, can improve their correctness without affecting time-to-market. This paper presents an empirical assessment comparing the application of these agile practices with more traditional approaches. Our study comprises independent experiments of pair versus solo programming, and test-first versus test-last programming. The first study involved 85 novice programmers who applied both traditional and agile approaches in the development of six auxiliary functions within three different domains. Our results suggest that the agile practices might bring benefits in this context. In particular, pair programmers delivered correct implementations much more often, and test-first programming encouraged the production of larger and higher coverage test sets. On the downside, the main experiment showed that both practices significantly increase total development time. A replication of the test-first experiment with professional developers shows similar results.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses requirements in software projects using agile methodologies (IC1), is a study from industry or academia (IC2), and employs quantitative research (IC3) through empirical experiments.

However, in some particular companies, there are multiple stakeholders, who represent different interests in prioritizing activities. There is, consequently, a heavy challenge to implement agile methodologies which deal with such conflicts in order to prioritize the features of the system. It is important to focus on higher earned value as possible and consider the technical risks exposed by the development team.

They are very limited in number and focus mainly on company structure and adherence to a specific Agile method rather than on tool usage and needs. For this reason, many companies have difficulties to choose appropriate tools to support their Agile process. One such company is the Swedish telecommunications giant Ericsson. To account for this lack of data, Ericsson commissioned us to conduct an independent survey focusing on the tool usage and needs as experienced by the Agile software community today. In this paper, we report on the results of our survey. The survey covers 121 responses from 120 different companies coming from 35 different countries.

To meet their need we have to perform requirement engineering which helps to identify and structure requirements. In traditional software development methods end users or stakeholders predefined their requirements and sent to the development team to analysis and negotiation to produce requirement specification. In many cases it is risky or very difficult and not economical to produce a complete, verifiable set of requirements. Traditional software development has a problem to deal with requirement change after careful analysis and negotiation. This problem is well tackled by the XP as XP recommends an on-site customer to represents their requirements through user stories on story cards. Generally customers have rarely a general picture of the requirements or system in their mind which leads problems related to requirements like requirements conflicts, missing requirements, and ambiguous requirements etc, and does not address non-functional requirements from exploration phase.",EXCLUDED,"The article discusses an improved story card-based requirement engineering practice for Extreme Programming.

Therefore, it is vital to address the critical determinants of effective innovation management within an organizational context, hence called organizational innovation. Based on some existing frameworks of managing organizational innovation, several key determinants can be identified. Using industrial survey data, we then proposed and used a neural network-based approach to quantify the connectivity between each of these determinants and organizational innovation. First, the modeling accuracy of our proposed method was examined and benchmarked with multiple linear regression and non-linear least square fitting methods. Next, the relative importance among various key determinants toward organizational innovation can be computed using our method.

958.0,Excluded,ec3,Converged ‘user integration’ provided as a mediated service,"In the world of machine-to-machine interaction, the success of Web Services technology owes much to its ability to define a contract between applications independent of the host machines’ underlying hardware and the transport mechanism linking them. With this contract, applications know what to expect of one another and this provides a solid foundation for integration. The resulting business process improvements translate directly into saved costs and new business opportunities. However, these workflow improvements typically come to a grinding halt whenever real-time input from consumers is required since there is currently no way to effectively construct the same sort of contract for spontaneous person-tomachine interactions as Web Services provides for machine-to-machine interaction. The consumer-to-machine link is characterised by reliability, availability, trust and conformance to message syntax all being in unbearable deficit … and all of that deficit being due to the user ‘component’ rather than the machine! For this reason, the solution designer will typically consider the user to be effectively unavailable and ‘park’ the workflow in a suitable state pending user intervention at some later date. If a mechanism were available to transform the user into a reliable, highly available, trusted component of the overall workflow system which always rendered its requests/responses in machine-readable form to an agreed syntax then that ‘component’ (the user) could be included in automated processes directly. This integration of the user into the workflow would have far-reaching impact on the way systems are designed and operated, providing the user with much greater control of service delivery and improving the overall service experience.This paper describes a prototype system and how the operator of such a system can support users employing a multitude of devices connected over various networks and offer to third parties a facility whereby they can very easily conduct structured interactions with those users in real time, on the device of their preference, without them requiring any knowledge of those users’ devices, addresses, networks, presence or device preferences. The users are restricted to supplying only valid messages which are forwarded to the third party in machine-readable format in order that their service logic can act on them automatically. The paper goes on to propose further opportunities arising from the ownership of such a facility.",EXCLUDED,"The article discusses Web Services and user integration, but it does not explicitly address software requirements.

Given that many services are available with the same function but different quality of service (QoS) properties, and service users have different QoS preferences, the challenge of service composition is to select appropriate service candidates to maximize the overall utility while satisfying a userâ€™s requirements. In this paper, we propose a decomposition-based approach for service composition, in which the utility of a composite service can be computed from the utilities of component services and the constraints of component services can be derived from the constraints of the composite service. Thus, with our approach, it is possible to independently manage the selection of each component service, leading to more scalability and more flexibility for service composition in a dynamic environment.

Incremental verification accommodates the changes that occur within the schedule of frequent releases of software agile processes. We propose a general approach to developing families of verifiers that can support incremental verification for different kinds of artifacts and properties. The proposed syntactic-semantic approach is rooted in operator precedence grammars and their support for incremental parsing.

We reported in a previous work a stress testing methodology to detect performance-related Real-Time (RT) faults in DRTSâ€™s based on the design \{UML\} model of a System Under Test (SUT). The stress methodology aimed at increasing the chances of \{RT\} failures (violations in \{RT\} constraints). Objective After stress testing a \{SUT\} and finding \{RT\} faults, an important immediate question is how to fix (debug) those \{RT\} faults and prevent the same \{RT\} violations in the future and after deployment. If appropriate solutions to this challenge cannot be found, stress testing and its findings (detection of \{RT\} faults) will be of no or little use to the quality assurance goals of the development team. Method To move towards systematically solving performance-related problems causing \{RT\} faults, we develop a customized version of the standard Software Performance Engineering process and conduct an experiment on a DRTS. The process is iteratively applied to a SUT, while results from stress testing reveal that there are still scenarios in which \{RT\} constraints are violated. Results Application of the performance engineering paradigm in this context on a real \{DRTS\} enables systematic analysis of performance-related defects and their fixations.

However, agile project management methodologies have not adequately captured planning and visualization activities for crosscutting concerns and non-functional requirements in agile practices. This research proposes a planning and visualization framework that would be used to schedule software non-functional requirements implementations while utilizing agile software development and project management agile techniques. The approach is validated through visual simulation and a case study. Results showed that utilizing a risk-driven agile planning approach that involve non-functional requirements resulted in shortening the project schedule by one to two months over a traditional 'Highest-Business-Value-First' agile scheduling technique.

As a main characteristic, it plans and organises the software project as a series of iterations that are guided by the User Objectives in an agile and user-centred manner. At each iteration, the software development work can be distributed to different teams according to some developmental and integration activities. Each activity is driven by models that are validated by a multidisciplinary team composed of developers and users. The requirements are incrementally collected and formalised by means of models based on user-centred design. Besides, the Semantically Enriched Humanâ€“Computer Interaction model is proposed to speed up project validation. This model enriches a humanâ€“computer interaction model with some visual characteristics and the application semantic.

The first generation was coded from an unorganized collection of requirements that were reviewed infrequently and informally. In contrast, the second was developed based on a set of requirements stored in a Requirements Management database and formally reviewed at each revision. Quality indicators for the second software product all improved dramatically even with the increased complexity of the newer product. This paper will recap that study and then present data from a subsequent Intel case study revealing that quality enhancements continued on the third generation of the product. The third generation software was designed and coded using the final set of requirements from the second version as a starting point. Key product differentiators included changes to operate with a new Intel processor, the introduction of new hardware platforms and the addition of approximately fifty new features. Software development methodologies were nearly identical, with only the change to a continuous build process for source code check-in added.

Secondly, extracted logics are built as a complete web service and FSM is constructed by the Business Logic model to state the logic flow. Thirdly, it ascertains the right way for evaluation by analyzing dependency between the service logics through FSM.

Mind mapping seems to provide a suitable solution for both parties: those who develop within an agile method and those who advocate proper requirements engineering practice. In this paper, mind mapping has been discussed as a suitable technique to elicit and represent requirements within the SCRUM model: specifically, we have focused on whether and how mind maps could lead to the development of a suitable product backlog, which in SCRUM plays the role of an initial requirements specification document. In order to experimentally assess how effectively practitioners could rely on a product backlog for their first development sprint, we have identified the adoption of mind maps as the independent variable and the quality of the backlog as the dependent variable, the latter being measured against the ""function points"" metric. Our hypothesis (i.e., mind maps are effective in increasing the quality of product backlogs) has been tested within an existing SCRUM project (the development of a digital library by an academic institution), and several promising data have been obtained and further discussed.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses requirements in software projects using agile methodologies (IC1), is a study from industry or academia (IC2), and employs quantitative research (IC3) by measuring the 'function points' metric.

2290.0,Included,included,Story Points Based Effort Estimation Model for Software Maintenance,"Software is developed with prior requirements and it is maintained continuously with rapid progresses in domain, technology, economy, and other fields. Software maintenance is vital and it requires more efforts and resources than development phase. There are fewer methods available for maintenance effort estimation. An iterative maintenance life cycle using extreme programming is a model for software maintenance based on agile methodology that uses \{RC\} stories as requirement artifacts. Agile methodology uses analogy and expert opinion based estimation techniques such as planning poker. But in software maintenance, historical data and experts may not be present or accurate. Therefore, a heuristic method is required for the calculation of maintenance efforts. In this paper, we propose a Software Maintenance Effort Estimation Model (SMEEM) for software maintenance estimation. The \{SMEEM\} technique uses story points to calculate the volume of maintenance and value adjustment factors that are affecting story points for effort estimation. The proposed model will be illustrated with various types of maintenance projects. The model generates accurate and effective results as compared to other software maintenance effort estimation models.

Especially if the need for evolution is not confined to a particular feature, but affects the whole value chain, finding dependencies and interrelationships between processes and components is challenging as it requires cross-departmental understanding. These issues can be even more challenging for management stakeholders who need to make high-level and far-reaching decisions on implementation strategies despite not being deeply involved in the technical details. One of the main problems in such projects is that the stakeholders who have expert knowledge typically have only little methodical experience, while the method experts lack the business experience.

The existing approach for dealing with such high-power interferers makes the 802.11 network switch to a different channel; yet the ISM band is becoming increasingly crowded with diverse technologies, and hence many 802.11 access points may not find an interference-free channel.This paper presents TIMO, a MIMO design that enables 802.11n to communicate in the presence of high-power cross-technology interference. Unlike existing MIMO designs, however, which require all concurrent transmissions to belong to the same technology, TIMO can exploit MIMO capabilities to decode in the presence of a signal from a different technology, hence enabling diverse technologies to share the same frequency band.

To facilitate a rational and efficient planning process, release planning models make such factors explicit and compute release plan alternatives according to optimization principles. However, experience suggests that industrial use of such models is limited. To investigate the feasibility of model and tool support, we compared input factors assumed by release planning models with factors considered by expert planners. The former factors were cataloged by systematically surveying release planning models, while the latter were elicited through repertory grid interviews in three software organizations. The findings indicate a substantial overlap between the two approaches. However, a detailed analysis reveals that models focus on only select parts of a possibly larger space of relevant planning factors. Three concrete areas of mismatch were identified: (1) continuously evolving requirements and specifications, (2) continuously changing prioritization criteria, and (3) authority-based decision processes.
