995.0,Included,included,Dependable solutions design by Agile Modeled Layered Security Architectures,"Our research entitled ""Designing Dependable Agile Layered Security Architecture Solutions"" addresses the innovative idea and novel implementations of Security Engineering for Software Engineering using Agile Modeled Layered Security Architectures for Dependable Privacy Requirements, with a validation of an exemplar case study of Web Services Security Architectures. Securing the Software Architecture in any application at design phase is known as Security Architectures, and we focus on authentication and authorization of the user. Now a day most of the applications are developed as a Layered Security Architecture Pattern, typically we have user presentation layer, Business Logic Layer and Database access layer. Now Agile modeling is used in all applications design (but Agile Modeled Architectures are given little importance) because of shortened developed time, with customer collaborations with developers and importantly with Test Driven Development approaches. Securing Agile Modeled architectures, which being an iterative development, will provide enhanced Dependable Security Requirements in terms of Privacy of user, in its successive iterations.

Both students and practitioners have suggested that one of the popular, lighter-weight, agile methods would be a better choice. This paper examines the educational goals for undergraduate Software Engineering education and considers how they might be met by the practices of eXtreme Programming.

2123.0,Included,included,"Scenarios, personas and user stories: User-centered evidence-based design representations of communicable disease investigations","AbstractPurpose Despite years of effort and millions of dollars spent to create unified electronic communicable disease reporting systems, the goal remains elusive. A major barrier has been a lack of understanding by system designers of communicable disease (CD) work and the public health workers who perform this work. This study reports on the application of user-centered design representations, traditionally used for improving interface design, to translate the complex \{CD\} work identified through ethnographic studies to guide designers and developers of \{CD\} systems. The purpose of this work is to: (1) better understand public health practitioners and their information workflow with respect to \{CD\} monitoring and control at a local health agency, and (2) to develop evidence-based design representations that model this \{CD\} work to inform the design of future disease surveillance systems. Methods We performed extensive onsite semi-structured interviews, targeted work shadowing and a focus group to characterize local health agency \{CD\} workflow. Informed by principles of design ethnography and user-centered design we created persona, scenarios and user stories to accurately represent the user to system designers. Results We sought to convey to designers the key findings from ethnographic studies: (1) public health \{CD\} work is mobile and episodic, in contrast to current \{CD\} reporting systems, which are stationary and fixed, (2) health agency efforts are focused on \{CD\} investigation and response rather than reporting and (3) current \{CD\} information systems must conform to public health workflow to ensure their usefulness. In an effort to illustrate our findings to designers, we developed three contemporary design-support representations: persona, scenario, and user story. Conclusions Through application of user-centered design principles, we were able to create design representations that illustrate complex public health communicable disease workflow and key user characteristics to inform the design of \{CD\} information systems for public health.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses requirements in software projects using agile methodologies (IC1) as it focuses on designing communicable disease information systems.

373.0,Excluded,ec3,Agile development: evaluation and experience,"Agile methods such as Extreme Programming, Crystal, Scrum, and others have attracted a lot of attention recently. Agile methods stress early and continuous delivery of software, welcome changing requirements, and value early feedback from customers. Agile methods seek to cut out inefficiency, bureaucracy, and anything that adds no value to a software product. Proponents of agile methods often see software specification and documentation as adding no value, which has led observers to conclude that agile development is nothing but unprincipled hacking, perhaps even an anarchic counter-reaction to bureaucratic, heavyweight software processes that demand ever more intermediate deliverables from developers. The purpose of this panel is to discuss under what circumstances agile methods work and don't work. Some of the key practices of agile methods are: scheduling according to feature priorities, incremental delivery of software, feedback from expert users, emphasis on face-to-face communication, pair development, minimalist design combined with refactoring, test-driven development, automated regression testing, daily integration, self-organizing teams, and periodic tuning of the methods. Working software is the primary measure of success.

An Experience Using Data Collection and Feedback,"Several works on agile methods discuss the use of team's workspace for displaying relevant information. The management of an Informative Workspace (IW) is a challenging task as it can involve many different subjects such as team adaptability, continuous reflection, workspace layout, human cognition, usability, etc. Our paper explores the IW management and it is divided in two phases. The first phase describes a data collection performed on 8 agile teams in order to identify valuable aspects on managing an IW based on their experiences. We proposed a series of suggestions to the teams in order to improve their current context using their IW and we gathered the feedbacks. This process leds to a set of seven heuristics for managing an IW.

1226.0,Excluded,ec3,Extensible Prototyping for pragmatic engineering of knowledge-based systems,"Knowledge-based systems (KBSs) have been built and practically applied in various contexts for decades. Yet, they still challenge developers by their complexity: Apart from a sound knowledge base they likewise require comprehensive user interface (UI) and interaction design for supporting the task at hand optimally. However, current KBS-Engineering methodologies still mostly focus on knowledge base development, regarding UI/interaction design a more incidental, low priority task. Thus, the \{UI\} often is developed in a rather ad hoc manner, thereby neglecting the potential of experimental design and creating reusable solutions. The integration of (rapid) evolutionary prototyping activities with \{KBS\} Engineering offers the chance for incorporating UI/interaction design more prominently into the process while at the same time leveraging the overall development task; specifically, we propose Extensible Prototyping as a tailored prototyping approach and we suggest its integration with the Agile Process Model for knowledge-based systems in this paper.

784.0,Included,included,Chapter 15 - Rapid \{CD\} and Other Methodologies,"Publisher Summary It is noted that the phases of rapid contextual design can be broken up into three fundamental partsâ€”namely, requirements gathering, work or activity redesign, and user experience design. These phases effectively maps well to any corporate or agile methodology particularly for basic requirements gathering, including business case, product or system requirements gathering, and personas and user scenarios. Rapid \{CD\} can easily supplement the deliverables required for the business analysis and requirements phases of most corporate processes. Paper prototyping is widely accepted as a means of testing design ideas and refining them. However, it should be accomplished with real user cases and not the canned test scenarios of some usability testing. The core of rapid \{CD\} is getting customer data and its implications into the design process and into the minds of designer and developers. It provides the data that is needed to guide business decisions, prioritize requirements, and produce high quality user experience. It is noted that rapid \{CD\} can augment other methods also.",INCLUDED,The article addresses requirements in software projects using agile methodologies (IC1) and is a study from industry or academia (IC2).

Our focus is to help software engineers manage the evolution of large and complex software systems by offering them effective and efficient ways to query and assess system properties using visual techniques. To this end, we combine several techniques from different domains, as follows. First, we construct an infrastructure that allows generic querying and data mining of different types of software repositories such as \{CVS\} and Subversion. Using this infrastructure, we construct several models of the software source code evolution at different levels of detail, ranging from project and package up to function and code line. Second, we describe a set of views that allow examining the code evolution models at different levels of detail and from different perspectives. We detail three views: the file view shows changes at line level across many versions of a single, or a few, files. The project view shows changes at file level across entire software projects. The decomposition view shows changes at subsystem level across entire projects. We illustrate how the proposed techniques, which we implemented in a fully operational toolset, have been used to answer non-trivial questions on several real-world, industry-size software projects.

Extreme designing follows on the footsteps of agile methods and is analogous to extreme programming. However, it is not radically committed to ""user interface coding"" (sketching or prototyping alone), but instead proposes to combine user interface sketches with a more structured representation such as an interaction model. By doing so, it brings together the advantages of sketching and prototyping as a communication tool, and of interaction modeling as a glue that binds together the sketches to allow designers to gain a more comprehensive view of and to reflection on the interactive artifact, thus promoting a more coherent and consistent set of design decisions.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses requirements in software projects using agile methodologies (IC1), is a study from academia (IC2), and presents qualitative research through a design approach (IC3).

Pair programming is supposed to be a practice suitable for this purpose. Unfortunately, the building of tacit knowledge is determined by factors that are difficult to isolate and capture because they concern personal attitude and capability. Thus, we have focused on the possible causes forming the individual ability, that can be isolated and studied, such as the individual education background. We have applied the practice of working in pairs to the design phase.

Not all software organizations are under this constraint, but the CMMI model offers benefit beyond just a marketing advantage. Agile methods have taken hold in many of the same organizations that stand to gain benefit from CMMI. CMMI adds some stress to the Agile approach by nature of more detailed planning and tracking. Microsoft and other software development organizations have endeavored to automate the more tedious aspects of CMMI, thus making it easier to support agile approaches within more rigid frameworks. The Microsoft Solutions Framework (MSF) initially founded on Microsoft software best practices observed internally and externally has expanded to integrate automated software configuration for team projects. The Team Foundation Server (TFS) product leverages MSF and supports both CMMI and Agile as process templates and provides tools around these templates to automate the use of either approach.

One characterization of software complexity is the existence of dependency relationship. Moreover, degree of dependency reflects the cohesion and coupling between software elements. Dependencies on design and implementation phase have been proven as important predictors for software bugs. We empirically investigated how requirements dependencies correlate with and predict software integration bugs, which can provide early estimate regarding software quality, therefore facilitate decision making early in the software lifecycle. We conducted network analysis on requirements dependency networks of two commercial software projects. We then performed correlation analysis between network measures (e.g., degree, closeness) and number of bugs. Afterwards, bug prediction models were built using these network measures. Significant correlation is observed between most of our network measures and number of bugs. These network measures can predict the number of bugs with high accuracy and sensitivity. We further identified the significant predictors for bug prediction. Besides, the indication effect of network measures on bug number varies among different types of requirements dependency.

To identify possible areas of concern, engineers must consider knowledge throughout the life cycle of similar or related products. However, because of the size and distributed nature of a company’s operation, engineers often do not have access to front-line maintenance data.

Are agile methods here to stay? Some claim that agile software development methods are in the mainstream adoption phase in the software industry, while others hope that those are a passing fad. The assumption here is that if agile would not provide real improvement, adopters would be eager at first but turn pessimistic after putting it into practice. Objective Despite the growing amount of anecdotal evidence on the success of agile methods across a wide range of different real-life development settings, scientific studies remain scarce. Even less is known about the perception of the impacts of agile transformation when it is deployed in a very large software development environment, and whether agile methods are here to stay. This study aims to fill that gap by providing evidence from a large-scale agile transformation within Nokia. While we have yet to confirm these findings with solid quantitative data, we believe that the perception of the impacts already pinpoints the direction of the impacts of large-scale agile transformation. Method The data were collected using a questionnaire. The population of the study contains more than 1000 respondents in seven different countries in Europe, North America, and Asia. Results The results reveal that most respondents agree on all accounts with the generally claimed benefits of agile methods. These benefits include higher satisfaction, a feeling of effectiveness, increased quality and transparency, increased autonomy and happiness, and earlier detection of defects. Finally, 60% of respondents would not like to return to the old way of working.

Put simply, process drives repeatabilityâ€”reducing the reliance on inspirationâ€”and creates a framework in which creative professionals can execute. Developers and engineers are also familiar with the use of process as a framework in which to increase the odds of repeatable results, and most have training and experience using a variety of software development processes. However, most have little experience with the â€œunderstand, design, validate, deliverâ€� sorts of processes frequently applied in design disciplines. Their own experience using a variety of engineering processes creates common ground for the two disciplines, and creates opportunities for setting expectations between the disciplines. In the design process, it is not uncommon to have to return to previous phases. Particularly in environments where clients or executives have the vision themselves to recognize that designers are not on a path to success, it is not uncommon to return to gather broader understanding about a domain, or competitors, or influences.

Another aspect of business process modeling involves the accurate capture of operational behavior and the associated process constraints. Whether the process is automated or manual, such operational constraints and behavior exist. This may include a variety of properties including performance expectations, policy constraints, and security controls. These characteristics later manifest as the non-functional requirements of an intended system, and often such information is generally identified at some point after the business process modeling exercise. The non-functional characteristics of the business are arguably more difficult to capture in business process modeling, since the focus of such methods is the modeling of functional behavior. We propose how two new artifacts may be applied to model the constraints associated with a business process. This is the operating condition to denote a business process constraint and the control case to define controlling criteria to mitigate risk associated with an operational condition. Modeling constraints in this way provides an opportunity to capture these characteristics of business process early in the systems development life-cycle.

While useful in teaching software engineering process concepts, this approach limits the team's ability to utilize feedback from downstream process activities. It also limits the students' opportunity to understand process improvement from their own experiences. The ability to respond to project change is also dampened by the fact that teams do not have the time or resources in this format to modify, or refactor the design of a project component let alone incorporate a new or modified customer requirement. Agile methodologies promote an evolutionary approach to development using short incremental release cycles. We report on the experiences of conducting a team project in an introductory software engineering course using agile development techniques at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Teams have the opportunity to experience multiple iterations of the software engineering life cycle and evolve a product design that allows for discoveries made during implementation and through the introduction of changing customer requirements. The project integrates the concept of test-driven development. This agile technique addresses testing early in the development process and reinforces the value of unit testing. The incorporation of agile techniques is not only useful for students in an introductory course, but may also be applied to upper division software engineering courses.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses requirements in software projects using agile methodologies (IC1), is a study from industry or academia (IC2), and is a primary study (IC4).

Contextual information not only facilitates improved applications, but can also become significant security parameters -- which in turn can potentially ensure service delivery not to anyone anytime anywhere, but to the right person at the right time and place. Specially, in determining access control to resources, contextual information can play an important role. Access control models, as studied in traditional computing security, however, have no notion of context-awareness; and the recent works in the nascent field of context-aware access control predominantly focus on spatio-temporal contexts, disregarding a host of other pertinent contexts. In this paper, with a view to exploring the relationship of access control and context-awareness in ubiquitous computing, we propose a comprehensive context-aware access control model for ubiquitous healthcare services. We explain the design, implementation and evaluation of the proposed model in detail.

However, relatively little research has been made on comparing what makes clients happy in 'traditional' companies that use planed-driven processes and in agile companies.

This paper fills in this gap and compares two software development companies in a Nord-European country in respect to client participation and its impact on the clients' satisfaction with the project. One of the companies is agile by its design while the other follows a 'traditional' software development approach. Our study suggests that active clients' participation is not an exclusive attribute of agile projects and that it can be successfully integrated (and implemented) in a 'traditional' project as well. Further, the study shows that by involving clients, software companies have the chance to get higher customer satisfaction, regardless whether or not they implement agile software development processes.

As business processes are assumed to fulfil organizational goals, goal models could be transformed into business process models that specify how business processes fulfil the organizational goals. Although both the fields of Goal-Oriented RE (GORE) and Business Process Management (BPM) received a lot of attention from researchers, the methods to transform goal models into business process models still need further research. This scientific evaluation paper analyses current methods to identify the practical challenges that need to be addressed for an effective transformation of goal models into business process models. We illustrate the discovered challenges using the case study of Seven-Eleven Japan. The main challenges that were discovered are a lack of responsible role, insufficient concept mappings, informality of the transformation algorithm, no full support for organisational structure and a lack of inter-model consistency checks. Our expected contribution of discovering these challenges is to lower the barriers of transferring new goal-to-process methods to industry.

The team could have postponed the \{UI\} evaluations but instead chose to try to take full advantage of the test participants already scheduled and to conduct a hybrid method wherein they, in parallel, gathered user requirements information and evaluated the \{UI\} prototype. They selected the pluralistic usability \{WT\} as their evaluation method, both because it allowed them to collect data from a number of these valuable and hard-to-schedule users at the same time and that it would allow for a dialogue between these representative users and the product developers, thus speeding up the back-and-forth that was necessary if they were to be engaged in an iterative design process. The team added a requirements-gathering exercise onto the front of the pluralistic usability \{WT\} to collect user requirements data before biasing the pluralistic usability \{WT\} participants with the \{UI\} prototype.

Unpredictable workloads, however, aggravate the semantic gap between the virtual machine monitor and guest operating systems, leading to inefficient resource management. In particular, \{CPU\} management for virtual machines has a critical impact on I/O performance in cases where the virtual machine monitor is agnostic about the internal workloads of each virtual machine. This paper presents virtual machine scheduling techniques for transparently bridging the semantic gap that is a result of consolidated workloads. To enable us to achieve this goal, we ensure that the virtual machine monitor is aware of task-level I/O-boundedness inside a virtual machine using inference techniques, thereby improving I/O performance without compromising \{CPU\} fairness. In addition, we address performance anomalies arising from the indirect use of I/O devices via a driver virtual machine at the scheduling level. The proposed techniques are implemented on the Xen virtual machine monitor and evaluated with micro-benchmarks and real workloads on Linux and Windows guest operating systems.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses requirements in software projects using agile methodologies (IC1) as it focuses on virtual machine scheduling and resource management in virtualized environments, specifically addressing the semantic gap in CPU management.
