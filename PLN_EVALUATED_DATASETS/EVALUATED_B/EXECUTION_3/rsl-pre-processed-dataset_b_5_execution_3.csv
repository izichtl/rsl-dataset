107.0,Excluded,ec3,A dynamic spectrum access network based on cognitive radio,"Dynamic spectrum access technologies based on Cognitive Radio (CR) is under intensive research carried out by the wireless communication society and is expected to solve the problem of spectrum scarcity. However, most enabling technologies related to dynamic spectrum access are considered individually. In this paper, we consider these key technologies jointly and introduce a new implementation scheme for a Dynamic Spectrum Access Network Based on Cognitive Radio (DSAN-BCR). We start with a flexible hardware platform for DSAN-BCR, as well as a flexible protocol structure that dominates the operation of DSAN-BCR. We then focus on the state of the art of key technologies such as spectrum sensing, spectrum resources management, dynamic spectrum access, and routing that are below the network layer in DSAN-BCR, as well as the development of technologies related to higher layers. Last but not the least, we analyze the challenges confronted by these mentioned technologies in DSAN-BCR, and give the perspectives on the future development of these technologies. The DSAN-BCR introduced is expected to provide a system level guidance to alleviate the problem of spectrum scarcity.",EXCLUDED,"The article focuses on a dynamic spectrum access network based on cognitive radio, which is a wireless communication technology.

1959.0,Excluded,ec3,Progress on standardization and automation in software development on \{W7X\},"For a complex experiment like \{W7X\} being subject to changes all along its projected lifetime the advantages of a formalized software development method have already been stated [1]. Quality standards like ISO/IEC-12207 provide a guideline for structuring of development work and improving process and product quality. A considerable number of tools has emerged supporting and automating parts of development work. On \{W7X\} progress has been made during the last years in exploiting the benefit of automation and management during software development:â€“ Continuous build, integration and automated test of software artefacts.âˆ˜ Syntax checks and code quality metrics. âˆ˜ Documentation generation. âˆ˜ Feedback for developers by temporal statistics. â€“ Versioned repository for build products (libraries, executables). â€“ Separate snapshot and release repositories and automatic deployment. â€“ Semi-automatic provisioning of applications. â€“ Feedback from testers and feature requests by ticket system. This toolset is working efficiently and allows the team to concentrate on development. The activity there is presently focused on increasing the quality of the existing software to become a dependable product. Testing of single functions and qualities must be simplified. So a restructuring is underway which relies more on small, individually testable components with standardized interfaces providing the capability to construct arbitrary function aggregates for dedicated tests of quality attributes as availability, reliability, performance. A further activity is on improving the development cycle. The use of release cycles has already provided favourable concentration of work and predictability of delivery times. However, the demand has risen, to react quickly on priority changes from W7X-project management. So a more agile development cycle is being prepared relying on smaller working packages, shorter release cycles and an associated release plan giving the software development responsible the possibility to react on a shorter time scale.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses requirements in software projects using agile methodologies (IC1), is a study from industry (implied by the context of W7X), and presents qualitative observations about the use of automation and agile practices (IC2 & IC3).

A well defined and well managed scope is very important for a qualitative, cost effective and timely completion of the project. In this paper we discussed the role and impact of the scope on two very broadly accepted methodologies for software development. The two methodologies adopt different techniques for the development of software.

2046.0,Excluded,ec3,Reputation-based self-management of software process artifact quality in consortium research projects,"This paper proposes a PhD research that deals with improving internal documentation in software projects. Software developers often do not like to create documentation because it has few value to the individual himself. Yet the purpose of internal documentation is to help others understand the software and the problem it addresses. Documentation increases development speed, reduces software maintenance costs, helps to keep development on track, and mitigates the negative effects of distance in distributed settings. This research aims to increase the individuals' motivation to write documentation by means of reputation. The CollabReview prototype is a web-based reputation system that analyzes artifacts of internal documentation to derive personal reputation scores. Developers making many good contributions will achieve higher reputation scores. These scores can then be employed to softly influence developer behavior, e.g. by incentivizing them to contribute to documentation with social rewards. No strict rule enforcement is necessary.",INCLUDED,The article addresses requirements in software projects using agile methodologies (IC1) and is a study (IC2).

2438.0,Excluded,ec3,The Combination of Agile and Lean in Software Development: An Experience Report Analysis,"There has been a noticeable focus shift from agile methods such as extreme Programming (XP) and Scrum to lean software development in the last several years, which is indicated as ""from agile to lean"". However, the reality may not be as simple or linear as the term implies. To provide a better understanding of the combined use of agile and lean approaches in software development, a set of experience reports were analysed. These reports were published in the past conferences dedicated to agile software development and report experiences of using both agile and lean. The results of the analysis show that agile and lean can be combined in different manners for different purposes in software development. Lean is often applied as guiding principles for agile development. When combined at practice level, flow-based lean processes tend to substitute time-boxed agile processes.",INCLUDED,The article addresses requirements in software projects using agile methodologies (IC1) and is a study analyzing experience reports (IC4).

652.0,Included,included,Balancing agile and structured development approaches to successfully manage large distributed software projects: A case study from the cruise line industry,"Agile methods and traditional structured approaches are often viewed as competing bi-polar choices. Agile methods such as Scrum and XP are recommended for small, co-located projects that involve changing requirements. The traditional structured plan-driven approaches, such as the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and the waterfall lifecycle frameworks, are recommended for large projects with stable requirements. If a project is large, strategically important, distributed, and has dynamic user requirements and organizational changes, it presents unique challenges that neither the agile methods nor the traditional structured approaches can effectively deal with alone. Although there is an increasing call for a balanced approach, there is little empirical research that shows when and how the two approaches can complement each other. Based on a case study from the cruise line industry of a large distributed strategic project with unanticipated changes, we conclude that this balance is not only workable, but is essential to ensure that the project demonstrates both control and agility for achieving its challenging and dynamic goals. Agile without structure can cause chaos, particularly in large complex distributed projects where planning, control, and coordination are critical. Structure without agility can lead to rigidity, particularly when a project involves a great deal of learning, discovery, and changes.

As software development continues to take advantage of the global market, agile methods are also being attempted in geographically distributed settings. In this paper, the authors discuss the usefulness of published research on agile global software development for the practitioner. It is contended that such published work is of minimal value to the practitioner and does not add anything to the guidance available before the existence of current agile methods.

1446.0,Included,included,Incorporating user centered requirement engineering into agile software development,"Agile Software Engineering approaches gain more and more popularity in today's development organizations. The need for usable products is also a growing factor for organizations. Thus, their development processes have to react on mis demand and have to offer approaches to integrate the factor ""usability"" in their development processes. The approach presented in this paper evaluates how agile software engineering models consider activities of Usability Engineering to ensure the creation of usable software products. The user-centeredness of the two agile SE models Scrum and XP has been analyzed and the question of how potential gaps can be filled without loosing the process' agility is discussed.

162.0,Excluded,ec3,A Methodology for Assessing Agile Software Development Methods,"Agile methods provide an organization or a team with the flexibility to adopt a selected subset of principles and practices based on their culture, their values, and the types of systems that they develop. More specifically, every organization or team implements a customized agile method, tailored to better accommodate its needs. However, the extent to which a customized method supports the organizational objectives, i.e. the `goodness' of that method, is questionable. Existing agile assessment approaches focus on comparative analyses, or are limited in scope and application. In this research, we propose a structured, systematic, and comprehensive approach to assessing the `goodness' of agile methods. We examine an agile method based on (1) its adequacy, (2) the capability of the organization to support the adopted principles and practices specified by the method, and (3) the method's effectiveness. We propose the Objectives, Principles and Practices (OPP) Framework to guide our assessment. The Framework identifies (1) objectives of the agile philosophy, (2) principles that support the objectives, (3) practices that are reflective of the principles, (4) linkages among the objectives, principles and practices, and (5) indicators for assessing the extent to which an organization supports the implementation and the effectiveness of that practice.

I will then go on to discuss how different XP practices reduce or increase the risks of software failure, especially when the reality of implementing XP is considered. I will identify weaknesses in the XP process, such as the use of user stories for requirements definition, that have to be addressed before XP practices will be considered by the critical systems community.

We have therefore looked at three known Security Engineering processes, Microsoft SDL, Cigatel touchpoints and Common Criteria and identified what specific security activities they performed. We then compared these activities with an Agile development process that is used in industry. Developers, from a large telecommunication manufacturer, were interviewed to learn their impressions on using these security activities in an agile development process.

Key characteristics of agile methods are lean and highly iterative development with a strong emphasis on stakeholder involvement. \{PLE\} leverages reuse through systematic approaches such as variability modeling or product derivation. Integrating agile approaches with product line engineering is an interesting proposition which â€“ not surprisingly â€“ entails several challenges: Product lines (PL) rely on complex plans and models to ensure their long-term evolution while agile methods emphasize simplicity and short-term value-creation for customers. When incorporating agility in product line engineering, it is thus essential to define carefully how agile principles can support particular \{PLE\} processes. For instance, the processes of defining and setting up a product line (domain engineering) and deriving products (application engineering) differ significantly in practices and focus with implications on the suitability of agile principles. This paper presents practical experiences of adopting agile principles in product line planning (a domain engineering activity). ThinkLets, i.e., collaborative practices from the area of collaboration engineering, are the building blocks of the presented approach as they codify agile principles such as stakeholder involvement, rapid feedback, or value-based prioritization.

The active vision paradigm is an effort to address these issues by enabling the seeing agent to manipulate its visual parameters in time and space so as to simplify its computational tasks and solve for the ambiguities in the process of visual perception. In this paper it is argued that if the goal of research in computational vision is considered to be that of understanding and designing seeing systems, then we need a design strategy. In our particular case, the design strategy has been influenced by anthropomorphic qualities. The empirical nature of such research also requires systems by which one can perform experiments in real-time and in interaction with the environment. This criterion has also been an important guide-line in the design of the system. The need for the manipulation of the visual parameters is a typical application of mechatronicsâ€”the interaction between the mechanics and electronicsâ€” of a complex perceptual system. By an analysis based on observations from the primate visual system, we describe the design of such a system. Details of its implementation and performance are also provided. To demonstrate that the system meets the requirements derived from our analysis, we finally describe a set of experiments with the designed robot head involving gaze control and the integration of a set of primary ocular processes.",EXCLUDED,"The article discusses a system for active vision and robot head design, incorporating mechatronics, but it does not explicitly address software requirements or focus on agile methodologies.

The agile approach was inspired by XP, but then tailored to meet the peculiar requirements. Two innovations were critical. The first innovation was promiscuous pair story authoring, where user stories were written by two people (similarly to pair programming), and the pairing changed very often (as frequently as every 15-20 minutes) to achieve promiscuity and cater for diverse point of views. The second innovation was an economic value evaluation (and not the cost) which was attributed to stories. Continuous recalculation of the financial value of the stories allowed to assess the projects financial return.

Several reports from large companies such as Bosch, Nokia, Philips and Siemens witness gains and benefits achieved with their use, especially with respect to the reduction on time to market. In SPL development, domain analysis plays a central role where the relevant features are identified. Feature-Oriented Domain Analysis is a method which uses a feature model to specify variabilities and commonalities of an SPL. However, activities related to the Domain Analysis process (managing commonalities and variabilities, with users visibility and relevant stakeholders) in most cases, do not seem to be a simple and easy activity, since to represent these analyzes in modelling domain tools with a certain degree of formality, requires a technical knowledge that domain experts do not always have it prior to use. But creative requirements techniques have been suggested to facilitate the elicitation activity by filling the gap the communications problems between domain experts and software engineers, making the domain analysis more agile. Thus, to improve the domain analysis process, this paper seeks to set out the use of a creative and agile technique for modelling requirements by means of mind maps for cognitive and effective support when building feature models.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses requirements in software projects using agile methodologies (IC1) as it proposes a creative and agile technique for modeling requirements using mind maps to improve the domain analysis process, which is a core aspect of SPL development.

The objective of the proposed dissertation project is to develop a similar pattern based approach that helps in analysing requirements from different disciplines and making them comprehensible for all stakeholders who need to agree to a requirement specification as the deliverable of requirements engineering. Due to the importance of legal aspects for, and users' trust in, socio-technical systems, requirement patterns will be developed for these two aspects. For the legal requirement patterns, legal requirements that are stable concerning changes due to their origin in fundamental, higher-ranked laws will be collected, and requirement patterns will be derived from them.

STS supports multiple idioms of specification : transitions, state-diagrams, scenarios etc. It also supports constructs for hierarchical organization of a specification. We have further defined analyses that are useful for review and inspection of STS specifications. A distinctive feature of our method is the ability to use analysis results to refine and reinforce parts of the specification by importing analysis results into STS specifications. In practice, this leads to a feedback loop where requirements can be rapidly refined using analysis engines to drive the development of requirements.

Evolutionary software development represents an alternative to plan-driven development in order to tackle today's turbulent environments. In agile development, a type of evolutionary development, the product owner (P.O.) who is the customer representative---real accountable role---is ill-equipped to identify and prioritize the stakeholders' most success-critical expectations and potential sources of business value. Furthermore, the tools he can use have their own scalability issues that question their underlying principles. Moreover, without a substantial involvement to take into account all stakeholders, software providers are more likely acting as commodity-utility providers than real business partners. In today's business context, there is a clear need for a value-driven development which embraces changes along with higher visibility and understanding of business transformations.
The current problems of software crisis could be condensed in a twofold business perspective dilemma: Doing the right product and providing efficient guidance to the development project. Approaches based on goals have been successfully used in Requirements Engineering (RE) and IT governance to address issues similar to the current software crisis.

These methodologies, such as Scrum, eXtreme Programming (XP), and Feature-Driven Development (FDD) date back to 1990s, and the Agile Manifesto was declared in 2001. However, already before that the concept of agile manufacturing (AM) was discovered to describe a corporate ability for quick adaptation to changing requirements. There is surprising amount in common between these two fields. This raises a question of whether NPD software development companies could take even more overall advantage of those different agile approaches. This interdisciplinary paper explores the commonalities between the key concepts of AM and some of the most popular agile software methods, and consequently suggests potential new areas for software process improvement (SPI) in large-scale NPD organizations. An industrial case example illustrates how agility in embedded software product development can be enhanced by following typical NPD principles. We conclude that there is potential for further improvements in software product development industry in general by seeing agility as a wider, organization-oriented business concept following the AM/NPD learning.

Functional test possibilities involving these relations are automatically summarized in a graph, being each path of the graph a user story testing scenario. Once a testing scenario is accepted by the customer, a testing script is automatically created. A web testing framework then executes the script, triggering the ATDD process.

Evidence from practice indicates that two simple physical artefacts (story cards and the wall), used in a particular and disciplined manner, and supported by appropriate social activity, are key to the success of co-located agile teams. However, little is known about this social activity or how communication and collaboration supports requirements activities in this setting. This paper reports an empirical study of a commercial agile team to investigate this issue. Using a combination of qualitative data collection and cognitive analysis techniques, we found evidence of gathering, evolving and clarifying requirements that are managed through patterns of communication.

To better understand the contextual nature of best practice, we want to explore how organisations actually go about achieving software objectives. We require a research framework that captures this information in a way that makes no assumptions about practices and that is descriptive in nature. We have developed a framework based on the perspective that practices exist to meet specific objectives. We have experimented with the framework by using it to capture the practices of three New Zealand organisations and by application to an idealised \{XP\} process. Our capture of organisational practices revealed interesting mechanisms for further study, including a dependence upon informal practices linked with strong communication and the idea of â€˜pushâ€™ versus â€˜pullâ€™ for information elicitation.

This study focused on designer and developer collaborations in the early stages of project work at four workplaces. We found designer-developer collaborations were extensive and we developed a categorization scheme of collaboration forms and artefacts that support this relationship. While some designer-developer collaborations were directed towards planning, which has been extensively researched, a larger part was directed towards realignment work. This latter type of collaborative work took three basic forms: scheduled, impromptu, and chats. Regardless of the form of collaboration, designer-developer interactions were mediated by twelve categories of artefacts.

Could it be that we were trying to solve the wrong problem? or that the real problems by far overshadow the process model issue? Or maybe the whole construction paradigm we use for software development is not suitable anymore? My position is that we should try the route of very simple software process models, to ensure a wider applicability, greater versatility, and acceptance. Possibly these new process models would be based on other paradigms of software or system development than the ""technical-rational"" construction idea.

This shift in perspective has gone relatively unnoticed by current software engineering research. This paper offers a glimpse at what processes and instruments lie beyond “current” software engineering research, where studying emergent DyNOs, their creation and steering becomes critical. To understand the underpinnings of this evolution, we explored a simple yet vivid scenario from real-life industrial practice. Using scenario analysis we elicited a number of social and organizational requirements in working with DyNOs. Also, comparing our evidence with literature, we made some key observations. First, managing DyNOs makes organizational requirements a first-class entity for development success.
