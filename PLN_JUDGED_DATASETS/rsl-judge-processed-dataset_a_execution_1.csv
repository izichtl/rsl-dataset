1770.0,Included,included,On agile performance requirements specification and testing,"Underspecified performance requirements can cause performance issues in a software system. However, a complete, upfront analysis of a software system is difficult, and usually not desirable. We propose an evolutionary model for performance requirements specifications and corresponding validation testing. The principles of the model can be integrated into agile development methods. Using this approach, the performance requirements and test cases can be specified incrementally, without big upfront analysis. We also provide a post hoc examination of a development effort at IBM that had a high focus on performance requirements. The examination indicates that our evolutionary model can be used to specify performance requirements such that the level of detail is commensurate with the nature of the project. Additionally, the IBM experience indicates that test driven development-type validation testing corresponding to the model can be used to determine if performance objectives have been met",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements in the context of agile methodologies, specifically performance requirements specification and testing, using an evolutionary model that can be integrated into agile development.

108.0,Included,included,A feasible user story tool for agile software development?,"User stories form the heart of the Extreme Programming methodology planning game. In its turn, Extreme Programming is one of the supporting pillars of the wider agile software development process. The user stories form a set of central work products that determine the software development processes. In the spirit of Extreme Programming the production of user stories is kept as simple as possible. Traditionally, user stories are hand written on index cards as they are easy to store, display, rearrange and distribute to the co-located development team. However, virtually all other work products of an application development team are in electronic format, and agile software development is increasingly being adopted by teams working from remote locations. In these circumstances distributed development teams look to software solutions for creating and using user stories. This paper surveys some of the tools that are being used and examines their suitability for the task using a set of requirements. As a result of this investigation the author has produced a prototype user story software tool for Agile Software Development called DotStories. The paper concludes by discussing the features of DotStories and its how closely it can approach the ideal user story software tool. Indeed, the proposition that software tools can ever improve on index cards is considered in the light of experience to date.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements in agile software development by evaluating user story tools and proposing a prototype (DotStories) that meets specific criteria.

Unlike more comprehensive modeling and configuration management products, Sprint is for smaller teams to use for design and specification, and allows designers to stay synchronized with customers, analysts, and developers.Driven by Shockwave or Flash prototypes, Sprint links project assets, such as personas, scenarios, screen designs, storyboards, requirements, and use cases, to form interactive specifications.

Given the benefits experienced and reported, \{SPL\} engineering has increasingly garnered interest from small to medium-sized companies. It is possible to find a wide range of studies reporting on the challenges of running a \{SPL\} project in large companies. However, very little reports exist that consider the situation for small to medium-sized enterprises and these studies try develop universal truths for \{SPL\} without lessons learned from empirical evidence need to be contextualized. This study is a step towards bridging this gap in contextual evidence by characterizing the weaknesses discovered in the scoping (SC) and requirements (RE) disciplines of SPL. Moreover, in this study we conducted a case study in a small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs) to justify the use of agile methods when introducing the \{SPL\} \{SC\} and \{RE\} disciplines through the characterization of their bottlenecks. The results of the characterization indicated that ineffective communication and collaboration, long iteration cycles, and the absence of adaptability and flexibility can increase the effort and reduce motivation during project development.

Scenarios are simulated and their outcomes are sent to the user's e-mail as a spreadsheet file, including data and pre-designed graphs to facilitate the interpretation of results. An example simulation study of a grazing-based finishing beef steers with a cycle of 12 months is presented, where new weaners enter the system in the autumn. Increased stocking rates, \{SR\} (150, 170, 190 and 210 heads in a 100-ha farm) and different summer maize feeding (SMF) rates were compared (SMF0&#xa0;=&#xa0;control and SMF1&#xa0;=&#xa0;intermittent rule-driven maize feeding during summer). In this simulation study, â€œdeviationsâ€� from user-defined targets are simplified into two associated rules (a) average farm herbage mass deviation to adjust herbage allowance, and (b) target animal live weight deviation, associated to SMF1.

1079.0,Excluded,ec3,Dynamic provisioning in multi-tenant service clouds,"Cloud-based systems promise an on-demand service provisioning system along with a “pay-as-you-use” policy. In the case of multi-tenant systems this would mean dynamic creation of a tenant by integrating existing cloud-based services on the fly. Presently, dynamic creation of a tenant is handled by building the required components from scratch. Although multi-tenant systems help providers save cost by allocating multiple tenants to the same instance of an application, they incur huge reconfiguration costs. Cost and time spent on these reconfiguration activities can be reduced by re-constructing tenants from existing tenant configurations supported by service providers. Multi-tenant cloud-based systems also lack the facility of allowing clients to specify their requirements. Giving clients the flexibility to specify requirements helps them avoid spending an excessive amount of time and effort looking through a list of services, many of which might not be relevant to them. Moreover, dynamic provisioning in the cloud requires an integrated solution across the technology stack (software, platform and infrastructure) combining functional, non-functional and resource allocation requirements. Existing research works in the area of web service matching, although numerous, still fall short, since they usually consider each requirement type in isolation and cannot provide an integrated solution. To that end, in this paper we investigate the features needed for dynamic service provisioning on the cloud. We propose a novel User Interface-Tenant Selector-Customizer (UTC) model and approach, which enables cloud-based services to be systematically modeled and provisioned as variants of existing service tenants in the cloud. Our approach considers functional, non-functional and resource allocation requirements, which are explicitly specified by the client via the user interface component of the model. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first such integrated approach. We illustrate our ideas using a realistic running example, and also present a proof-of-concept prototype built using IBM’s Rational Software Architect modeling tool. We also present experimental results demonstrating the applicability of our matching algorithm. Our results show significant reduction in matching time with the help of an elimination process that reduces the search space needed for performing matching.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements in the context of agile methodologies.

In our experiences with off shoring Japanese software development projects to China, we were having difficulties with low quality deliverables and high turnover rate of Chinese members because of social differences. Our attempts to create a common culture were not very successful because people in general are less likely to change their basic views and behavior in a short period of time. We, however, were able to obtain success by acknowledging that differences are going to exist and adopting and adapting agile practices in consideration of the existence of these differences. We will show Kaizen as is used by a Japanese company in software development. We will focus on our experiences with social differences we've found and how we continuously adapted practices in our project to take better advantage of the situation as relationship between members changed. It is based on our over 10 years of experience in trying to improve a software package development at a software company in China, which has now become our subsidiary. During our attempts, we have learned the importance of agile mentality in resolving value difference issues.

However, after analyzing many of the existing traceability approaches it can be concluded that they strongly depend on traditional development process characteristics. Within this paper it is justified that this is a drawback to support adequately agile processes. As it is discussed, some concepts do not have the same semantics for traditional and agile methodologies. This paper proposes three features that traceability models should support to be less dependent on a specific development process: (1) user-definable traceability links, (2) roles, and (3) linkage rules. To present how these features can be applied, an emerging traceability metamodel (TmM) will be used within this paper. TmM supports the definition of traceability methodologies adapted to the needs of each project. As it is shown, after introducing these three features into traceability models, two main advantages are obtained: 1) the support they can provide to agile process stakeholders is significantly more extensive, and 2) it will be possible to achieve a higher degree of automation.

1753.0,Included,included,NORMATIC: A visual tool for modeling Non-Functional Requirements in agile processes,"There is consensus in the research community that agile software development methodologies, such as Scrum, are becoming more and more popular in delivering quality Functional Requirements (FRs). However, agile methodologies have not adequately modeled Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) and their potential solutions (operationalizations) with FRs in early development phases-let alone having tools to support such initiatives. This research proposes NORMATIC, a Java-based simulation tool for modeling non-functional requirements for semi-automatic agile processes. NORMATIC is the semi-automatic tool that supports the more general Non-Functional Requirements Modeling for Agile Processes (NORMAP) Methodology. Early results show that the tool can potentially help agile software development teams in reasoning about and visually modeling NFRs as first-class artifacts early on during requirements gathering and analysis phases.

Each student was asked to keep a development diary and answer questionnaires during and at the end of the project. Each group was asked to document the changes to their development process, identified development problems, employed mitigation strategies and the project progress in form of a retrospective report.

Determining and negotiating the scope in a product line that spans several business units with their own economic goals is challenging.

A precondition for feature modeling is the identification of all features supporting the product line. To identify these features, we developed a method for systematically deriving a feature model top down based on domain know-how. We call this method domain specific feature modeling. As the primary artifact to describe the problem space, a domain specific feature model additionally improves the requirement understanding for all stakeholders by considerably improving the scoping, traceability, testing, efficiency and transparency of planning activities and making the development efforts easier to estimate.

1182.0,Excluded,ec7,Evidence Management for Evolutionary Safety Assurance and Certification,"Safety assurance and certification are amongst the most expensive and time-consuming activities in the development of safety-critical systems. Deeming a system to be safe involves gathering convincing evidence to argue the safe operation of the system, usually according to the requirements of some safety standard. To handle large collections of safety evidence effectively, practitioners need knowledge of how to classify different types of evidence, how to structure the evidence to show fulfilment of standards' requirements, and how to assess the evidence. However, the notion of evidence is vague and safety standards' requirements can be ambiguous and difficult to understand. Major problems also arise when a system evolves, as the body of safety evidence has to be adequately maintained in order to ensure system safety and allow its demonstration. In this context, this PhD aims to propose a framework for safety evidence management in evolutionary scenarios.

In today’s complex and dynamic business environment, companies are often prevented from effectively and efficiently evaluating relevant factors necessary for developing their core capability strategic systems. These systems, with inherent human decision-making processes, should be fully considered when creating a method for determining a firm’s suitable or required core capabilities. It is helpful to implement IT-based group decision support systems (GDSS) with soft computing algorithms to assist managers in determining the appropriate core capabilities for the firm. Therefore, this study develops a holistic group decision support system in which similarity measures, fuzzy set theory, and fuzzy mathematics programming are implemented to facilitate managers in making decisions.

The customer representative is constantly under pressure and may experience difficulties in foreseeing the adequacy of a release plan. Objective To assist release planning in \{XP\} by structuring the planning problem and providing an optimization model that suggests a suitable release plan. Method We develop an optimization model that generates a release plan taking into account story size, business value, possible precedence relations, themes, and uncertainty in velocity prediction. The running-time feasibility is established through computational tests. In addition, we provide a practical heuristic approach to velocity estimation. Results Computational tests show that problems with up to six themes and 50 stories can be solved exactly. An example provides insight into uncertainties affecting velocity, and indicates that the model can be applied in practice.

These are well known for their benefits like focus on quality, early business value delivery, higher morale of stakeholders, and the reduced cost/schedule. Also, they can support the earlier and quicker production of the code by dividing the product into small segments called iterations. However, there are on-going debates about their flexibility to accommodate changing requirements and whether the productivity and quality of the agile processes is satisfactory for the customers or not. Previously available studies have mostly focused on comparing XP(eXtreme Programming) with some other agile methodologies, rather than comparing it with traditional plan-driven software development methodologies.

54.0,Included,included,"7 - Methodology, Application Development, and System Architecture","Publisher Summary This chapter explores methodologies, types of methodologies, process models, application development environments, emulators, and tools. It also discusses integrated development environments (IDE), and hardware and system architecture. Methodology directly addresses the application development and project management of the upcoming project. Two of the methodologies are the waterfall method and the extreme programming model. It is noted that any number of methods can be used to develop a software project. Process model refers to building a commonality of thought processes in scope, features, deliverables, and expectations throughout the system development life cycle. It is also observed that every process model exhibits some level of requirements that need to be met and there is essentially a systems project as a deliverable to answer these requirements. The waterfall method is a deliberate and calculated system of structured development. One of the major characteristic of this type of development is the heavy emphasis on the requirements document. However, extreme programming relies on user stories. This storyboarding of ideas and concepts embraces change more readily and allows for more opportunity in what the customer actually needs and wants.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address any agile methodology, violating Exclusion Criterion EC7.

2616.0,Included,included,Towards approximating COSMIC functional size from user requirements in agile development processes using text mining,"Measurement of software size from user requirements is crucial for the estimation of the developmental time and effort. COSMIC, an ISO/IEC international standard for functional size measurement, provides an objective method of measuring the functional size of the software from user requirements. COSMIC requires the user requirements to be written at a level of granularity, where interactions between the internal and the external environments to the system are visible to the human measurer, in a form similar to use case descriptions. On the other hand, requirements during an agile software development iteration are written in a less formal way than use case descriptions - often in the form of user stories, for example, keeping with the goal of delivering a planned release as quickly as possible. Therefore, size measurement in agile processes uses methods (e.g. story-points, smart estimation) that strictly depend on the subjective judgment of the experts, and avoid using objective measurement methods like COSMIC. In this paper, we presented an innovative concept showing that using a supervised text mining approach, COSMIC functional size can be automatically approximated from informally written textual requirements, demonstrating its applicability in popular agile software development processes, such as Scrum.

1776.0,Excluded,ec3,On guiding the augmentation of an automated test suite via mutation analysis,"Mutation testing has traditionally been used as a defect injection technique to assess the effectiveness of a test suite as represented by a “mutation score.” Recently, mutation testing tools have become more efficient, and industrial usage of mutation analysis is experiencing growth. Mutation analysis entails adding or modifying test cases until the test suite is sufficient to detect as many mutants as possible and the mutation score is satisfactory. The augmented test suite resulting from mutation analysis may reveal latent faults and provides a stronger test suite to detect future errors which might be injected. Software engineers often look for guidance on how to augment their test suite using information provided by line and/or branch coverage tools. As the use of mutation analysis grows, software engineers will want to know how the emerging technique compares with and/or complements coverage analysis for guiding the augmentation of an automated test suite. Additionally, software engineers can benefit from an enhanced understanding of efficient mutation analysis techniques. To address these needs for additional information about mutation analysis, we conducted an empirical study of the use of mutation analysis on two open source projects. Our results indicate that a focused effort on increasing mutation score leads to a corresponding increase in line and branch coverage to the point that line coverage, branch coverage and mutation score reach a maximum but leave some types of code structures uncovered. Mutation analysis guides the creation of additional “common programmer error” tests beyond those written to increase line and branch coverage. We also found that 74% of our chosen set of mutation operators is useful, on average, for producing new tests. The remaining 26% of mutation operators did not produce new test cases because their mutants were immediately detected by the initial test suite, indirectly detected by test suites we added to detect other mutants, or were not able to be detected by any test.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements in the context of agile methodologies.

2047.0,Included,included,Requirement analysis in agile software development of distributed systems,"Agile methodologies (DSDM, XP, Crystal, SCRUM, etc.) have been adopted as popular approaches to software development mainly because of their capability to deliver the end product faster and incorporate changes to the requirements. Agile follows iterative development, i.e. the implementation of software systems in successive releases. A side effect of multiple releases is introducing inconsistencies to the requirements that may lead to unpredictability of the system behavior at the run-time. Unpredictable systems are hard to debug and harder to manage. It is believed that agile methods can benefit from using more quantified and yet light-weight approaches across the entire development life cycle and particularly, the analysis of requirements for correctness. Checking for consistency of requirements prior to their implementation can remove the predictability problem and lead to significant savings in time and maintenance cost. This research proposes the utilization of a software tool which employs methodologies to automatically analyze system requirements in agile development and detect inconsistencies. The portrayal of requirements via user stories in agile development is used for this purpose. The advantages of adding requirement analysis methodologies to agile development are illustrated using a case study of a real-time drilling simulator.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements in agile methodologies (e.g., DSDM, XP, SCRUM) using a case study of a real-time drilling simulator.

1830.0,Excluded,ec3,Patterns for agile development practice part 3 (version 4),"This set of ten patterns is intended to complement the standard wisdom that can be gleaned from the Agile Development literature such as Kent Beck's Extreme Programming Explained[1]. It is directed primarily at those who are starting out with Extreme Programming or another agile methodology and might miss some subtle ideas. Once a team gains experience these patterns will become obvious, but initially some of them are counter intuitive. While this study began in Extreme Programming practice, most of the advice applies to agile development in general. The ten patterns here extend the work of 2004--2006 on the same topic ([3] and [4]). This paper contains some of the standard practices of Extreme Programming as detailed in [1]. We consider XP to be a pattern language in which the practices are the basis of the patterns. They have the characteristics of a true Pattern Language in that they are synergistic and generative. The dozen or so practices detailed in Beck and elsewhere, such as ""Do the simplest thing that could possibly work"" and ""Yesterday's Weather"", form a subset of this language. As this ""language"" is in its early stages of development, there is no significance to the current ordering of the patterns here.

2072.0,Excluded,ec7,Requirements-Driven Adaptive Security: Protecting Variable Assets at Runtime," Security is primarily concerned with protecting assets from harm. Identifying and evaluating assets are therefore key activities in any security engineering process - from modeling threats and attacks, discovering existing vulnerabilities, to selecting appropriate countermeasures. However, despite their crucial role, assets are often neglected during the development of secure software systems. Indeed, many systems are designed with fixed security boundaries and assumptions, without the possibility to adapt when assets change unexpectedly, new threats arise, or undiscovered vulnerabilities are revealed. To handle such changes, systems must be capable of dynamically enabling different security countermeasures. This paper promotes assets as first-class entities in engineering secure software systems. An asset model is related to requirements, expressed through a goal model, and the objectives of an attacker, expressed through a threat model. These models are then used as input to build a causal network to analyze system security in different situations, and to enable, when necessary, a set of countermeasures to mitigate security threats. The causal network is conceived as a runtime entity that tracks relevant changes that may arise at runtime, and enables a new set of countermeasures. We illustrate and evaluate our proposed approach by applying it to a substantive example concerned with security of mobile phones.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements in the context of agile methodologies.

1791.0,Included,included,On the Usage of Context for Requirements Elicitation: End-User Involvement in IT Ecosystems," Today's systems are faced with the need of constant evolution to remain competitive, especially when looking at IT Ecosystems and their growing number of subsystems. As a prerequisite for these to stay competitive, system providers need a clear understanding of their stakeholder's needs. As systems tend to be increasingly complex nowadays, support an increasingly number of stakeholders, have a shorter release cycles to evolve and need to adapt to the environment and the users, some of the standard requirements elicitation techniques tend not to be suitable any more. Especially when adaptivity is necessary, system providers need to understand the context, in which the systems are used, but also the context of users for the adaptation. In this paper I concentrate on the largest stakeholder group, namely the end-users for requirements elicitation. Evaluation criteria include (i) support of context, (ii) scalability to large numbers of end-users, and (iii) scalability to large numbers of end-user's needs and problems that lead to new requirements. My literature review suggests that this important field is currently underrepresented in Requirements Engineering research. This research proposes to develop a framework that explains the different context types and their role for requirements elicitation. The framework is then used to investigate existing requirements elicitation techniques and their potential for considering context. It is also used to show how emerging techniques can further support requirements elicitation with context.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address any agile methodology as explicitly stated in the exclusion criterion EC7.

While the community seems split into two camps of for and against, the majority of extreme programmers favour to define the system using only the traditional customer focused user stories. In some cases the technical story arguments are academic, but our experience report demonstrates clearly why sticking to user stories has its benefits. Our experience using Scrum and XP has been that allowing technical stories into the process can de-rail the ability to deliver constant, measurable business value per iteration, as well as inhibit the planning process. Once technical stories are allowed, the customer and business can be alienated very quickly, especially when they have no engineering background.

324.0,Included,included,Acquiring and sharing tacit knowledge in software development teams: An empirical study,"AbstractContext Sharing expert knowledge is a key process in developing software products. Since expert knowledge is mostly tacit, the acquisition and sharing of tacit knowledge along with the development of a transactive memory system (TMS) are significant factors in effective software teams. Objective We seek to enhance our understanding human factors in the software development process and provide support for the agile approach, particularly in its advocacy of social interaction, by answering two questions: How do software development teams acquire and share tacit knowledge? What roles do tacit knowledge and transactive memory play in successful team performance? Method A theoretical model describing the process for acquiring and sharing tacit knowledge and development of a \{TMS\} through social interaction is presented and a second predictive model addresses the two research questions above. The elements of the predictive model and other demographic variables were incorporated into a larger online survey for software development teams, completed by 46 software SMEs, consisting of 181 individual team members. Results Our results show that team tacit knowledge is acquired and shared directly through good quality social interactions and through the development of a \{TMS\} with quality of social interaction playing a greater role than transactive memory. Both \{TMS\} and team tacit knowledge predict effectiveness but not efficiency in software teams. Conclusion It is concluded that \{TMS\} and team tacit knowledge can differentiate between low- and high-performing teams in terms of effectiveness, where more effective teams have a competitive advantage in developing new products and bringing them to market. As face-to-face social interaction is key, collocated, functionally rich, domain expert teams are advocated rather than distributed teams, though arguably the team manager may be in a separate geographic location provided that there is frequent communication and effective use of issue tracking tools as in agile teams.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements in software projects using agile methodologies, as it explores how tacit knowledge is acquired and shared in software development teams, with a focus on social interaction—key to agile practices.

However, on average, only 24% of each of the meetings that we studied focused on this task. We found that 35% of the meeting was spent on elaborating problem issues and discussing possible solutions. Very little time was used for coordinating tasks.

This is particularly evident in systems analysis, design, and development methodologies. This paper asks if it is possible that the lack of emphasis upon ethical considerations in development methodologies can result in the failure of advanced technology development projects? In order to explore this contention, the paper sets out the findings of a case study of a large-scale advanced technology project in a multinational engineering company involving the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system. The research examined the extent to which ethical issues emerged in the project and assesses the impact of ethical considerations upon the technology development process and its outcomes. Evidence is presented which shows how ethical concerns clearly impacted upon the outcome of the project, supporting the contention that ethics was a success factor in the case presented. However, it was also clear that the kinds of ethical considerations that emerged were highly complex, and associated with an “ethics of care”.

1202.0,Included,included,Experiences integrating sophisticated user experience design practices into agile processes,"Most significant software processes involve a wide range of disciplines, from programming to testing, and from documentation to database development. Unfortunately, agile processes are typically presented from the point of view of programmers, with the other disciplines often left feeling excluded and disenfranchised. One such discipline is that of user experience design (often abbreviated UED), a discipline encompassing several key specialties including user research, interface design, visual design and usability testing. UED activities span the full lifecycle of product development from early requirements analysis to construction and testing, spanning both large scale system issues and detailed components, with its work products forming key inputs and deliverables of many development activities. In this experience report, we discuss the author's coaching experiences integrating sophisticated UED practices into the agile process initiatives of several organizations. His background is initially that of a programmer and later that of an agile process coach, and we'll explore his journey understanding UED practices and how they map to popular agile processes, mainly Scrum in ""agile software development with Scrum"" by K. Schwaber and M. Beedle (2002) and extreme programming in ""extreme programming explained: embrace change"" by K. Beck (2000).

It follows the guidelines suggested by Extreme Programming (XP) that require highly expressive programming languages (i.e., Java) and \{CASE\} tools.

Further, for effective guidance on the development, it directs the construction of system components by imposing an architecture-based concept of layered specification and construction of these components through its activities. Since the method follows the guidelines suggested by \{XP\} and supports effective guidance by a layered development of architectural components, team productivities can be greatly enhanced with less (but effective) overheads on specification work.

1972.0,Included,included,Quality Attribute Driven Agile Development,"Agile development methods are being recognized as popular and efficient approaches to the development of software systems that have features such as a short delivery period and unclear requirements. They emphasize customer satisfaction, fast response to changes, and release in less time. According to a recent survey, SCRUM is one of the most popular methods that are currently being used. Some backlogs, especially high priority backlogs that are functional requirements of customers, are developed repeatedly at each sprint period. Despite the known advantages of SCRUM, however, its backlogs focus only on functional features. Thus, it is difficult to effectively reflect the softwares quality attributes. As known, the failure of a software project is caused by the non-satisfaction not of functional features but of quality attributes, such as performance, usability, and reliability. This paper introduces the ACRUM that is a quality attribute driven agile development method. The main characteristic of the proposed solution is that it is derived from values and practices of SCRUM to be compatible with the SCRUM process and to keep its agility intact. The effect of ACRUM was evaluated through an agile process evaluation checklist and applying it into a commercial project of Samsung Electronics.

However, selecting from a large number of requirements is a decision problem that requires negotiating with multiple stakeholders and satisficing their value propositions. In this paper I present a two-step value-based requirements prioritization approach based on TOPSIS, a decision analysis framework that tightly integrates decision theory with the process of requirements prioritization. In this two-step approach the software system is initially decomposed into high-level Minimal Marketable Features (MMFs) which the business stakeholders prioritize against business goals. Each individual MMF is further decomposed into low-level requirements/features that are primarily prioritized by the technical stakeholders. The priorities of the low-level requirements are influenced by the MMFs they belong to. This approach has been integrated into Winbook, a social-networking influenced collaborative requirements management framework and deployed for use by 10 real-client project teams for the Software Engineering project course at the University of Southern California in Fall 2012. This model allowed the clients and project teams to effectively gauge the importance of each MMF and low-level requirement and perform various sensitivity analyses and take value-informed decisions when selecting requirements for implementation.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements in the context of agile methodologies through a value-based prioritization approach integrated into a collaborative requirements management framework.

2286.0,Excluded,ec5,Static composition of refactorings,"The number of possible refactorings is unlimited, so no tool vendor will ever be able to provide custom refactorings for all specific user needs. Therefore, we propose a new kind of refactoring tools, which allow users to create, edit and compose required refactorings just like any other documents. The heart of such a refactoring editor is the ability to compose larger refactorings from existing ones. Computing the precondition of the composite refactoring from the preconditions of the composed refactorings is non-trivial since earlier transformations influence the truth of preconditions of later ones. The ability to calculate these effects without referring to a particular program to which the refactorings should be applied is called program-independent composition. It is the prerequisite for creating composite refactorings that are reusable on arbitrary programs. The main contribution of this paper is a formal model for automatic, program-independent composition of conditional program transformations. We show that conditional transformations, including refactorings, can be composed from a limited set of basic operations. Program-independent derivation of a precondition for the composite is based on the notion of â€œtransformation descriptionâ€�, which can be seen as a simplified, yet equally powerful, variant of Robertsâ€™ â€œpostconditionsâ€� (Practical analysis for refactoring, Ph.D. Thesis (1999)). Our approach simplifies the implementation of refactoring toolsâ€”only the basic operations and the ability for composition must be hard coded in a tool.

We deliver despite non-ideal circumstances, including development work that can be categorized as exploratory research, regular use of part-time developers, team size that varies widely among Sprints, highly specialized technical skill sets and a broad range of deliverables. We believe our methodologies can be applied to many research-oriented environments such as those found in government laboratories, academic institutions and corporate research facilities. Our goal is to increase the adoption of Lean/Agile project management in these environments by sharing our experiences with those research-oriented development teams who are considering using Lean/Agile, or have started and are encountering problems. In this paper we discuss how we create and prioritize our product backlog, write our user stories, calculate our capacity, plan our Sprints, report our results and communicate our progress to customers.

We seek to provide a rich analysis and a deep understanding of three cases in an exploratory study that was carried out in a large and mature company, widely recognized for its excellence and its engagement in outsourced software development. We used in-depth interviews for data collection and grounded theory techniques for data analysis. Our exploration efforts yielded the following findings: (i) understanding requirements dependencies is of paramount importance for the successful deployment of agile approaches in large outsourced projects. (ii) Next to business value, the most important prioritization criterion in the setting of outsourced large agile projects is risk. (iii) The software organization has developed a new artefact that seems to be a worthwhile contribution to agile software development in the large: â€˜delivery storiesâ€™, which complement user stories with technical implications, effort estimation and associated risk. The delivery stories play a pivotal role in requirements prioritization. (iv) The vendor's domain knowledge is a key asset for setting up successful client-developer collaboration. (v) The use of agile prioritization practices depends on the type of project outsourcing arrangement.

The amount of work carried out by the Information Technology (IT) tools varies from 60% to 100% depending on the design phase and the shipyard. Decision support provides the designer with methods to find optimal solutions, as the charge of an innovative structure of previous projects is limited. New techniques as virtual reality are now available in the ship design offices. Ship design is a typical collaborative work leading to concurrent engineering. \{IT\} is widely used not only within the shipyard, but also with sub-contracting companies and suppliers. The various partners involved in the design tools developmentâ€”shipyards, software vendors, classification societies, and research centersâ€”have clearly identified that the real challenge for the future is still dealing with data exchange. A ship remains a very complex product with many systems and a large and complicated arrangement. A 3D model available from the early design stage helps reduce fastidious time-consuming and error-generating tasks and modifies and makes consistent overall process up to detailed design.

In previous research we proposed countermeasure graphs (CGs), an approach to conduct risk analysis, combining the ideas of different risk analysis approaches. The approach was designed for reuse and easy evolvability to support agile software development. \{CGs\} have not been evaluated in industry practice in agile software development. In this research we evaluate the ability of \{CGs\} to support practitioners in identifying the most critical threats and countermeasures. The research method used is participatory action research where \{CGs\} were evaluated in a series of risk analyses on four different telecom products. With Peltier (used prior to the use of \{CGs\} at the company) the practitioners identified attacks with low to medium risk level. \{CGs\} allowed practitioners to identify more serious risks (in the first iteration 1 serious threat, 5 high risk threats, and 11 medium threats). The need for tool support was identified very early, tool support allowed the practitioners to play through scenarios of which countermeasures to implement, and supported reuse. The results indicate that \{CGs\} support practitioners in identifying high risk security threats, work well in an agile software development context, and are cost-effective.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software security risk assessment in agile software development, specifically evaluating countermeasure graphs (CGs) in an industry context using participatory action research.

However, the reality may not be as simple or linear as this label implies. To provide a better understanding of lean software development approaches and how they are applied in agile software development, we have examined 30 experience reports published in past agile software conferences in which experiences of applying lean approaches in agile software development were reported. The analysis identified six types of lean application. The results of our study show that lean can be applied in agile processes in different manners for different purposes.

Based on 58 semi-structured interviews, we report experiences of scaling the Product Owner role in two large globally distributed projects, each with 20 or more Scrum teams.

The challenge lies in the difficulty of analyzing and assessing the proneness to requirement changes across multiple versions, especially when the scale of requirements is large. In this paper, we define a series of metrics to characterize historic evolution information, and propose a novel method for predicting requirements that are likely to evolve in the future based on the metrics. We apply the prediction method to analyze the product updates history through a case study. The empirical results show that this method can provide a tradeoff solution that narrows down the scope of change analysis to a small set of requirements, but it still can retrieve nearly half of the future changes. The results indicate that the defined metrics are sensitive to the history of requirements evolution, and the prediction method can reach a valuable outcome for requirement engineers to balance their workload and risks.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements in the context of agile methodologies, as it focuses on predicting requirement changes based on historical evolution data without mentioning any agile framework or methodology.

Additionally designers communicate. It takes at least as much time to communicate the design to other people as it does to generate and plan the solution. Where the designer's word is lawâ€”or where there is an interfering \{VP\} or a scatterbrained PMâ€”late feature revelations are disastrous. The \{HCI\} field has strenuously proven in the last 25 years that it is worth the engineering time to generally have high-level design researched and completed before engineering work begins. But in practice, particularly at software companies, the detailed subtleties of interface design are very rarely reason to restructure the database or hold back on launch. And even though product planning typically begins before significant engineering expenditure, the people who do the product planning are very rarely people who are trained in user-centered product design. Designers are often seen as more of an engineering resource: someone to call in when one starts to build, not when one starts to plan. Ellen Beldner is the User Experience director at ChoiceVendor, a business software startup in San Francisco. She has been designing software in Silicon Valley since 2000, including four years as a \{UE\} designer at Google (when this essay was originally written) and a year leading the design of You Tube's monetization and copyright-monitoring software.

618.0,Excluded,ec3,Assessment methodology for software process improvement in small organizations,"Context Diagnosing processes in a small company requires process assessment practices which give qualitative and quantitative results; these should offer an overall view of the process capability. The purpose is to obtain relevant information about the running of processes, for use in their control and improvement. However, small organizations have some problems in running process assessment, due to their specific characteristics and limitations. Objective This paper presents a methodology for assessing software processes which assist the activity of software process diagnosis in small organizations. There is an attempt to address issues such as the fact that: (i) process assessment is expensive and typically requires major company resources and (ii) many light assessment methods do not provide information that is detailed enough for diagnosing and improving processes. Method To achieve all this, the \{METvalCOMPETISOFT\} assessment methodology was developed. This methodology: (i) incorporates the strategy of internal assessments known as rapid assessment, meaning that these assessments do not take up too much time or use an excessive quantity of resources, nor are they too rigorous and (ii) meets all the requirements described in the literature for an assessment proposal which is customized to the typical features of small companies. Results This paper also describes the experience of the application of this methodology in eight small software organizations that took part in the \{COMPETISOFT\} project. The results obtained show that this approach allows us to obtain reliable information about the strengths and weaknesses of software processes, along with information to companies on opportunities for improvement. Conclusion The assessment methodology proposed sets out the elements needed to assist with diagnosing the process in small organizations step-by-step while seeking to make its application economically feasible in terms of resources and time.

Sur la base de la distinction entre lâ€™acceptation opÃ©ratoire et sociale, les auteurs effectuent un panorama des concepts et notions mobilisÃ©s par le paradigme de lâ€™acceptation, pour ensuite le critiquer et proposer de considÃ©rer quâ€™humains et technologies sont reliÃ©s par des interactions si Ã©troites que lâ€™on peut parler de symbiose humain-machine, comme lâ€™avait suggÃ©rÃ© Licklider (1960). La premiÃ¨re partie est consacrÃ©e aux diffÃ©rents aspects ergonomiques de lâ€™acceptation opÃ©ratoire (utilisabilitÃ©, critÃ¨res ergonomiques, modÃ¨les de lâ€™interaction) tandis que la seconde partie Ã©voque les aspects psychosociaux de lâ€™acceptation (modÃ¨le de lâ€™acceptation technologique, thÃ©orie de la satisfaction de lâ€™utilisateur, thÃ©orie de la disconfirmation des attentes, thÃ©orie de lâ€™agilitÃ© organisationnelleâ€¦). Lâ€™exercice de la critique de ces deux orientations amÃ¨ne Ã  considÃ©rer que la technologie nâ€™est pas forcÃ©ment Ã  penser comme un corps Ã©tranger que lâ€™humain doit accepter ou refuser mais plutÃ´t comme une partie de nous-mÃªmes qui se comporte, dâ€™un point de vue mÃ©taphorique, comme un symbiote. Ã€ partir du moment oÃ¹ humains et technologies commencent Ã  former des unitÃ©s cohÃ©rentes et indissociables, la relation entre lâ€™humain, la technologie et lâ€™organisation peut sâ€™apprÃ©hender selon une approche symbiotique qui considÃ¨re quâ€™humains et technologies sont reliÃ©s par des rapports de forte dÃ©pendance. En somme, cet article propose de considÃ©rer quâ€™aujourdâ€™hui, la notion de symbiose est plus Ã  mÃªme dâ€™expliquer la relation de lâ€™humain Ã  la technologie que celle dâ€™acceptation. This article proposes a criticism of the concept of technology acceptance. Starting from a distinction between operational and social acceptance, the authors present an overview of the concepts and notions associated to the paradigm of technology acceptance. Then, they criticize the paradigm and propose the idea that human and technologies are connected by interactions that are so narrow that one can refer to human-machine symbiosis, as Licklider (1960) suggested. The first part of the paper is devoted to the various ergonomic aspects of the operational acceptance (usability, ergonomic criteria, model of the interaction) while the second part addresses the psychosocial aspects of acceptance (Technology Acceptance Model, User Information Satisfaction Theory, Expectancy Disconfirmation Theory, Agile Organizational Developmentâ€¦). The idea behind the authorsâ€™ point of view is that technology must not inevitably be thought of as a foreign thing that the human must accept or refuse. From a metaphorical point of view, technology is more and more part of ourselves and behaves like a symbiont. From the time human and technologies start to form coherent and linked units, the relation between human, technology and organization can be apprehended according to a symbiotic approach which considers that human and technologies are connected by strong dependent relationships.

We argue that traditional agile development techniques that persuade against the use of architectures and processes can fail or provide suboptimal delivery in such situations. It is argued that elements of software, infrastructure, and data architecture are necessary prerequisites for the successful delivery of complex agile system development projects. The chapter suggests that these architectural elements should be identified in each project via a risk-based approach. These resulting architecture elements can then be used by a distributed low-cost delivery organization to reduce rework within the agile software development process and accelerate delivery by maximizing the overall delivery pipeline. The chapter argues that this agile architecting technique successfully enables the low-cost and low-risk delivery of complex agile system development projects.",EXCLUDED,"The article is a chapter from a book, not a standalone study, and does not present empirical research or data.

Similarly, software usability has been the major success factor for interactive systems. Agile usability engineering has been motivated as a booming solution to develop better usability in a cost-effective manner. eXtreme Scenario Based Design (XSBD) is one of the effective agile usability approaches. However, XSBD does not provide explicit metrics to quantify the software usability. In this paper, we propose the Quantified eXtreme Scenario Based Design (QXSBD) approach, which complements XSBD with a set of usability metrics collected from the agile architecture-centric approach and the Quality in Use Integrated Model (QUIM). Further, QXSBD specifies the subset of usability metrics that need to be assessed at the major milestones in agile process. This integration employs the Usability Critical Parameters Workshop (UCPW) to provide engineering practices defining the usability requirements and design goals. We demonstrate the QXSBD, process through customer request project case study. The obtained results have shown that usability issues have been reduced by about 30%.

The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is the foundation on which the architecture, design, and implementation of a trading/investment system are built. While prototypes have been created for most features, the team will encounter and address them one by one in an iterative fashion. An \{SRS\} for a trading/investment system consists of the combined, ordered, and linked descriptions and documents, and prototypes created in earlier stages, including data dictionary, data maps and data flow maps, \{GUI\} requirements, error handling maps, and report generation maps. An iteration plan lays out the designâ€“buildâ€“test scenario for each piece of the system, tackling the features with the highest business priority and risk first. The team leader uses timeboxed iteration cycles to track progress of completed tasks and features as development progresses and at each iteration planning meeting, the development team breaks down features into tasks and assigns tasks to team members. When team members complete tasks, they erase them or cross them out. During iteration meetings, the team should also make estimates for computer capacity, server and database use, and network capacity, which should all be documented as they impact departments and personnel external to the development team. The team should also be cognizant of risks to external dependencies, such as delays caused by other departments or vendors. The quickest way to shorten a software development schedule is to buy components or reuse existing software.

Models are often used to describe partial aspects from the whole set of requirements. Hence, flaws and vagueness in requirements are common and hard to discover. Upcoming standards like ISO 26262 request the automotive industry to be more strict and formal on the requirements. Formal notation and unambiguitiy is explicitely stated. In the field of system and acceptance testing requirements are the basis for all activities. Although, requirements are often not close to testing. To overcome this we introduced the Timed Usage Model (TUM) as a formal representation of requirements specification. During the creation of the model the requirements are analyzed and brought into an unambiguous and formal representation. Traceability is achieved, as each path in the model must be based upon a requirement. The formulation of the requirements in form of an unambiguous model clarifies the requirements and helps to detect design errors. During the creation of the model omissions and flaws in the requirements are discovered. The model serves as a communication medium when functionality responsibles are involved to clarify these aspects. Timed Usage Models were created for power train functionality and the energy management. Moreover, the model as a formalized representation of the requirements served as the basis for the whole testing process, including test planning, test case generation, and test campaign analysis.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address any agile methodology as explicitly stated in Exclusion Criterion EC7.

Some authors have argued that ASD methods have limited applicability to large-scale projects because agile stories are not sufficient to capture the complexities of up-front design. This paper reports a 2.5-year field study of how an ASD team for a complex software system adapted the user story concept and the Scrum approach. The team sought to create a convention for representing agile stories which could capture the complexities of the system requirements without burdening the team with unneeded documentation. They developed eight different ways to represent a story. The core representation of the approach was called a HyperEpic, a structured collection of closely-related HyperStories. HyperEpics required 90-99% fewer words than conventional specifications. Because of their dense form, Hyper-epics were not useful for other phases in the design/build processes. The team evolved a design/build work practice that proceeded in stages. In each stage, stories underwent a one or more transformations. Each transformation represented stories differently to create varied kinds of understandings among different stakeholder sets.

To solve these problems we propose A New Improved Requirement Elicitation (Gathering) Process framework for story cards in XP to improve quality of user stories to capture functional and non-functional user requirements on story cards.

However, agile methodologies have not adequately modeled Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) and their potential solutions (operationalizations) with FRs in early development phases. This research proposes three fundamental agile artifacts to model FRs, NFRs, and their potential solutions in a visual environment. First, FRs are modeled through Agile Use Cases (AUCs). Second, NFRs are modeled through Agile Loose Cases (ALCs). Third, NFRs potential solutions are modeled through Agile Choose Cases (ACCs). AUCs are newly proposed hybrid of use cases and agile user stories. ALCs are proposed loosely-defined agile NFRs. ACCs are proposed potential solutions (operationalizations) for ALCs. The three artifacts are combined in a visual framework to promote agile modeling of NFRs (primarily) and how they are linked to FRs. The artifacts are the building blocks of a more comprehensive framework for modeling NFRs in agile software development processes.

In this paper we focus on the functionality of two key physical artefacts â€“ the story card and the Wall â€“ which, individually and in combination, underpin the teamâ€™s activity. These artefacts have two main roles â€“ one which enables a shared understanding of requirements and one which facilitates the development process itself. We consider these roles from two perspectives: a notational perspective and a social perspective. This discussion shows how the two perspectives â€“ the notational and the social â€“ intertwine and are mutually supportive.

We support collaboration by means of a tool-supported modeling approach that allows one to capture existing and agentified processes in a format that is sufficiently simple to be understood and maintained by domain experts.

Compared to the extensive research done on requirement selection, very little research has been performed on time scheduling. In this paper, we introduce two integer linear programming models that integrate time scheduling into software release planning. Given the resource and precedence constraints, our first model provides a schedule for developing the requirements such that the project duration is minimized. Our second model combines requirement selection and scheduling, so that it not only maximizes revenues but also simultaneously calculates an on-time-delivery project schedule. Since requirement dependencies are essential for scheduling the development process, we present a more detailed analysis of these dependencies. Furthermore, we present two mechanisms that facilitate dynamic adaptation for over-estimation or under-estimation of revenues or processing time, one of which includes the Scrum methodology. Finally, several simulations based on real-life data are performed. The results of these simulations indicate that requirement dependency can significantly influence the requirement selection and the corresponding project plan. Moreover, the model for combined requirement selection and scheduling outperforms the sequential selection and scheduling approach in terms of efficiency and on-time delivery.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements in the context of agile methodologies, specifically mentioning the Scrum methodology as a mechanism for dynamic adaptation.

Rather than trying to understand all of a system's detailed requirements before development, they carry out high-level release planning and then drive small development increments in cycles of one or two weeks. Doing so avoids many of the potential problems in traditional, phased software development approaches and accepts that changes are inevitable. Storytest-driven development brings requirements and automated testing ideas and practices together to support this agile process. The author describes this development approach and how its concrete examples can clarify and communicate business rules, aid agile team discussions, and facilitate team members' understanding of the concepts at the heart of the business needs.

1833.0,Included,included,Perceived productivity threats in large agile development projects,"Applying agile methodology in large software development projects introduces many challenges. For example, one may expect that the combination of autonomous teams and the necessity for an overall organizational control structure may lead to conflicts, and one may expect that Agile's informal means of knowledge sharing breaks down as the number of project participants increases. Such issues may in turn compromise the project's productivity. In order to better understand potential threats to productivity in large agile development projects, we conducted repertory grid interviews with 13 project members on their perceptions of threats to productivity. The project was a large software development project consisting of 11 Scrum teams from three different subcontractors. The repertory grid sessions produced 100 issues, which were content analyzed into 10 main problem areas: (1) Restraints on collaboration due to contracts, ownership, and culture, (2) Architectural and technical qualities are given low priority, (3) Conflicts between organizational control and flexibility, (4) Volatile and late requirements from external parties, (5) Lack of a shared vision for the end product, (6) Limited dissemination of functional knowledge, (7) Excessive dependencies within the system, (8) Overloading of key personnel, (9) Difficulties in maintaining well-functioning technical environments, (10) Difficulties in coordinating test and deployment with external parties.

149.0,Included,included,A literature review of agile practices and their effects in scientific software development,"The nature of scientific research and the development of scientific software have similarities with processes that follow the agile manifesto: responsiveness to change and collaboration are of the utmost importance. But how well do current scientific software development processes match the practices found in agile development methods, and what are the effects of using agile practices in such processes? In order to investigate this, we conduct a literature review, focusing on evaluating the agility present in a selection of scientific software projects. Both projects with intentionally agile practices and projects with a certain degree of agile elements are taken into consideration. In the agility assessment, we define and utilize an agile mapping chart. The elements of the mapping chart are based on Scrum and XP, thus covering two of the most prominent agile reference models. We compared the findings of the literature review to results of a previously conducted survey. The comparison indicates that scientific software development projects adopting agile practices perceive their testing to be better than average. No difference to average projects was perceived regarding requirements-related activities. Future work includes an in-depth case study to further investigate the existence and impact of agility in three large scientific software projects, ultimately aiming at a better understanding of the particularities involved in developing scientific software.

1032.0,Excluded,ec3,Development of auxiliary functions: should you be agile? an empirical assessment of pair programming and test-first programming,"A considerable part of software systems is comprised of functions that support the main modules, such as array or string manipulation and basic math computation. These auxiliary functions are usually considered less complex, and thus tend to receive less attention from developers. However, failures in these functions might propagate to more critical modules, thereby affecting the system's overall reliability. Given the complementary role of auxiliary functions, a question that arises is whether agile practices, such as pair programming and test-first programming, can improve their correctness without affecting time-to-market. This paper presents an empirical assessment comparing the application of these agile practices with more traditional approaches. Our study comprises independent experiments of pair versus solo programming, and test-first versus test-last programming. The first study involved 85 novice programmers who applied both traditional and agile approaches in the development of six auxiliary functions within three different domains. Our results suggest that the agile practices might bring benefits in this context. In particular, pair programmers delivered correct implementations much more often, and test-first programming encouraged the production of larger and higher coverage test sets. On the downside, the main experiment showed that both practices significantly increase total development time. A replication of the test-first experiment with professional developers shows similar results.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements in software projects using agile methodologies (pair programming and test-first programming), specifically focusing on auxiliary functions.

They are very limited in number and focus mainly on company structure and adherence to a specific Agile method rather than on tool usage and needs. For this reason, many companies have difficulties to choose appropriate tools to support their Agile process. One such company is the Swedish telecommunications giant Ericsson. To account for this lack of data, Ericsson commissioned us to conduct an independent survey focusing on the tool usage and needs as experienced by the Agile software community today. In this paper, we report on the results of our survey. The survey covers 121 responses from 120 different companies coming from 35 different countries.

To meet their need we have to perform requirement engineering which helps to identify and structure requirements.

In many cases it is risky or very difficult and not economical to produce a complete, verifiable set of requirements. Traditional software development has a problem to deal with requirement change after careful analysis and negotiation. This problem is well tackled by the XP as XP recommends an on-site customer to represents their requirements through user stories on story cards.

With this contract, applications know what to expect of one another and this provides a solid foundation for integration. The resulting business process improvements translate directly into saved costs and new business opportunities. However, these workflow improvements typically come to a grinding halt whenever real-time input from consumers is required since there is currently no way to effectively construct the same sort of contract for spontaneous person-tomachine interactions as Web Services provides for machine-to-machine interaction. The consumer-to-machine link is characterised by reliability, availability, trust and conformance to message syntax all being in unbearable deficit … and all of that deficit being due to the user ‘component’ rather than the machine! For this reason, the solution designer will typically consider the user to be effectively unavailable and ‘park’ the workflow in a suitable state pending user intervention at some later date. If a mechanism were available to transform the user into a reliable, highly available, trusted component of the overall workflow system which always rendered its requests/responses in machine-readable form to an agreed syntax then that ‘component’ (the user) could be included in automated processes directly. This integration of the user into the workflow would have far-reaching impact on the way systems are designed and operated, providing the user with much greater control of service delivery and improving the overall service experience.This paper describes a prototype system and how the operator of such a system can support users employing a multitude of devices connected over various networks and offer to third parties a facility whereby they can very easily conduct structured interactions with those users in real time, on the device of their preference, without them requiring any knowledge of those users’ devices, addresses, networks, presence or device preferences.

Given that many services are available with the same function but different quality of service (QoS) properties, and service users have different QoS preferences, the challenge of service composition is to select appropriate service candidates to maximize the overall utility while satisfying a userâ€™s requirements. In this paper, we propose a decomposition-based approach for service composition, in which the utility of a composite service can be computed from the utilities of component services and the constraints of component services can be derived from the constraints of the composite service. Thus, with our approach, it is possible to independently manage the selection of each component service, leading to more scalability and more flexibility for service composition in a dynamic environment. The experiment studies show that our approach can achieve a near-optimal solution with a significantly improved performance in computation time.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements in the context of agile methodologies, as it focuses on service composition and QoS guarantees in service-oriented architecture, which is unrelated to software project requirements management using agile approaches.

Responding to requirements changes is one of the principles of agile methodologies. In this paper we envision the seamless integration of automated verification techniques within agile methodologies, thanks to the support for incrementality. Incremental verification accommodates the changes that occur within the schedule of frequent releases of software agile processes. We propose a general approach to developing families of verifiers that can support incremental verification for different kinds of artifacts and properties. The proposed syntactic-semantic approach is rooted in operator precedence grammars and their support for incremental parsing. Incremental verification procedures are encoded as attribute grammars, whose incremental evaluation goes hand in hand with incremental parsing.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements in the context of agile methodologies, specifically focusing on incremental verification as a response to changing requirements, which aligns with agile principles.

1194.0,Excluded,ec7,Experience and challenges with UML-driven performance engineering of a Distributed Real-Time System,"Context Performance-related failures of Distributed and Real-Time Software Systems (DRTSâ€™s) can be very costly, e.g., explosion of a nuclear reactor. We reported in a previous work a stress testing methodology to detect performance-related Real-Time (RT) faults in DRTSâ€™s based on the design \{UML\} model of a System Under Test (SUT). The stress methodology aimed at increasing the chances of \{RT\} failures (violations in \{RT\} constraints). Objective After stress testing a \{SUT\} and finding \{RT\} faults, an important immediate question is how to fix (debug) those \{RT\} faults and prevent the same \{RT\} violations in the future and after deployment. If appropriate solutions to this challenge cannot be found, stress testing and its findings (detection of \{RT\} faults) will be of no or little use to the quality assurance goals of the development team. Method To move towards systematically solving performance-related problems causing \{RT\} faults, we develop a customized version of the standard Software Performance Engineering process and conduct an experiment on a DRTS. The process is iteratively applied to a SUT, while results from stress testing reveal that there are still scenarios in which \{RT\} constraints are violated. Results Application of the performance engineering paradigm in this context on a real \{DRTS\} enables systematic analysis of performance-related defects and their fixations.

However, a move toward open innovation requires a focus that goes beyond a single customer representative, involving a broader range of stakeholders, both inside and outside the organisation in a continuous, systematic way. Objective This paper provides an in-depth discussion of the applicability and implications of open innovation in an agile environment. Method We draw on two illustrative cases from industry. Results We highlight some distinct problems that arose when two project teams tried to combine agile and open innovation principles. For example, openness is often compromised by a perceived competitive element and lack of transparency between business units. In addition, minimal documentation often reduce effective knowledge transfer while the use of short iterations, stand-up meetings and presence of on-site customer reduce the amount of time for sharing ideas outside the team.

Over the years, many methods and techniques have been proposed to improve their elicitation, documentation, and validation. Knowing more about the state of the practice on these topics may benefit both practitioners' and researchers' daily work. A few empirical studies have been conducted in the past, but none under the perspective of software architects, in spite of the great influence that NFRs have on daily architects' practices. This paper presents some of the findings of an empirical study based on 13 interviews with software architects.

2589.0,Excluded,ec7,Toward Automating Requirements Satisfaction Assessment,"This paper introduces the automation of satisfaction assessment: the process of determining the satisfaction mapping of natural language textual requirements to natural language design elements. Satisfaction assessment is useful because it assists in discovering unsatisfied requirements early in the lifecycle when such issues can be corrected with lower cost and impact than later. We define the basic terms and concepts for this process and explore the feasibility of developing baseline methods for its automation. This paper describes the satisfaction assessment approach algorithmically and then evaluates the effectiveness of two proposed information retrieval (IR) methods in two industrial studies - one based on a large dataset including a complete requirements specification and design specification for a NASA science instrument, and one based on a smaller dataset for an open source project management dataset.

2480.0,Excluded,ec7,The Impact of Requirements on Software Quality across Three Product Generations," In a previous case study, we presented data demonstrating the impact that a well-written and well-reviewed set of requirements had on software defects and other quality indicators between two generations of an Intel product. The first generation was coded from an unorganized collection of requirements that were reviewed infrequently and informally. In contrast, the second was developed based on a set of requirements stored in a Requirements Management database and formally reviewed at each revision. Quality indicators for the second software product all improved dramatically even with the increased complexity of the newer product. This paper will recap that study and then present data from a subsequent Intel case study revealing that quality enhancements continued on the third generation of the product. The third generation software was designed and coded using the final set of requirements from the second version as a starting point. Key product differentiators included changes to operate with a new Intel processor, the introduction of new hardware platforms and the addition of approximately fifty new features. Software development methodologies were nearly identical, with only the change to a continuous build process for source code check-in added. Despite the enhanced functionality and complexity in the third generation software, requirements defects, software defects, software sightings, feature commit vs. delivery (feature variance), defect closure efficiency rates, and number of days from project commit to customer release all improved from the second to the third generation of the software.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements and their impact on software quality in the context of agile methodologies, even though it does not explicitly name an agile methodology.

Mind mapping seems to provide a suitable solution for both parties: those who develop within an agile method and those who advocate proper requirements engineering practice. In this paper, mind mapping has been discussed as a suitable technique to elicit and represent requirements within the SCRUM model: specifically, we have focused on whether and how mind maps could lead to the development of a suitable product backlog, which in SCRUM plays the role of an initial requirements specification document. In order to experimentally assess how effectively practitioners could rely on a product backlog for their first development sprint, we have identified the adoption of mind maps as the independent variable and the quality of the backlog as the dependent variable, the latter being measured against the ""function points"" metric. Our hypothesis (i.e., mind maps are effective in increasing the quality of product backlogs) has been tested within an existing SCRUM project (the development of a digital library by an academic institution), and several promising data have been obtained and further discussed.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements in agile development using the SCRUM methodology, specifically focusing on mind mapping as a technique to improve product backlog quality.

2290.0,Included,included,Story Points Based Effort Estimation Model for Software Maintenance,"Software is developed with prior requirements and it is maintained continuously with rapid progresses in domain, technology, economy, and other fields. Software maintenance is vital and it requires more efforts and resources than development phase. There are fewer methods available for maintenance effort estimation. An iterative maintenance life cycle using extreme programming is a model for software maintenance based on agile methodology that uses \{RC\} stories as requirement artifacts. Agile methodology uses analogy and expert opinion based estimation techniques such as planning poker. But in software maintenance, historical data and experts may not be present or accurate. Therefore, a heuristic method is required for the calculation of maintenance efforts. In this paper, we propose a Software Maintenance Effort Estimation Model (SMEEM) for software maintenance estimation. The \{SMEEM\} technique uses story points to calculate the volume of maintenance and value adjustment factors that are affecting story points for effort estimation. The proposed model will be illustrated with various types of maintenance projects. The model generates accurate and effective results as compared to other software maintenance effort estimation models.

2011.0,Excluded,ec7,Reducing complexity using an interaction room: an experience report,"Large-scale information system evolution projects often place high demands on both business and technical stakeholders' cognitive and communication skills. Especially if the need for evolution is not confined to a particular feature, but affects the whole value chain, finding dependencies and interrelationships between processes and components is challenging as it requires cross-departmental understanding. These issues can be even more challenging for management stakeholders who need to make high-level and far-reaching decisions on implementation strategies despite not being deeply involved in the technical details. One of the main problems in such projects is that the stakeholders who have expert knowledge typically have only little methodical experience, while the method experts lack the business experience.

Devices like baby monitors and cordless phones can cause a wireless LAN to lose connectivity. The existing approach for dealing with such high-power interferers makes the 802.11 network switch to a different channel; yet the ISM band is becoming increasingly crowded with diverse technologies, and hence many 802.11 access points may not find an interference-free channel.This paper presents TIMO, a MIMO design that enables 802.11n to communicate in the presence of high-power cross-technology interference. Unlike existing MIMO designs, however, which require all concurrent transmissions to belong to the same technology, TIMO can exploit MIMO capabilities to decode in the presence of a signal from a different technology, hence enabling diverse technologies to share the same frequency band.

The former factors were cataloged by systematically surveying release planning models, while the latter were elicited through repertory grid interviews in three software organizations. The findings indicate a substantial overlap between the two approaches.

In agile application development, many developers and users are asked to design systems in a short period of time. These applications may use components that are embedded in software repositories. The challenge then is how to select the right software components (data and procedures) to meet an application requirement. Although experienced developers may select and customize components to meet the needs of an application, such expertise may not be available to other applications.

1359.0,Excluded,ec3,History of a Large Test Automation Project Using Selenium,"In 2007 I started work as a tester for a company called Socialtext. When I joined the company there was already a Selenium-based test framework in place, but there were only a couple of automated test cases created; we had about 400 test steps, or individual assertions about the behavior of the application. When I left Socialtext two years later, we had just surpassed 10,000 test steps in the main set of regression tests. We also had browser-specific test sets in place, an automated test case for visually checking the application, and a Continuous-Integration-like script that ran all day and all night against the latest version of the code. At about 4000 test steps, regression bugs released to production dropped essentially to zero. The other 6000 test steps covered ongoing new features in the project, and more robust testing of the older application functions. This report discusses how I helped grow this system, and the things we learned along the way that helped it be such a successful ongoing project. The report covers initial conditions and test design; discusses issues in application feature coverage; how and when to grow the system quickly; a couple of test design smells that caused us problems along the way; how we treat Continuous Integration in a system like this; and how we coped when significant parts of the User Interface were completely re-engineered.",EXCLUDED,"The article is a personal account and retrospective report of a test automation project using Selenium, but it does not address software requirements in the context of agile methodologies.

A major barrier has been a lack of understanding by system designers of communicable disease (CD) work and the public health workers who perform this work. This study reports on the application of user-centered design representations, traditionally used for improving interface design, to translate the complex \{CD\} work identified through ethnographic studies to guide designers and developers of \{CD\} systems. The purpose of this work is to: (1) better understand public health practitioners and their information workflow with respect to \{CD\} monitoring and control at a local health agency, and (2) to develop evidence-based design representations that model this \{CD\} work to inform the design of future disease surveillance systems. Methods We performed extensive onsite semi-structured interviews, targeted work shadowing and a focus group to characterize local health agency \{CD\} workflow. Informed by principles of design ethnography and user-centered design we created persona, scenarios and user stories to accurately represent the user to system designers. Results We sought to convey to designers the key findings from ethnographic studies: (1) public health \{CD\} work is mobile and episodic, in contrast to current \{CD\} reporting systems, which are stationary and fixed, (2) health agency efforts are focused on \{CD\} investigation and response rather than reporting and (3) current \{CD\} information systems must conform to public health workflow to ensure their usefulness. In an effort to illustrate our findings to designers, we developed three contemporary design-support representations: persona, scenario, and user story. Conclusions Through application of user-centered design principles, we were able to create design representations that illustrate complex public health communicable disease workflow and key user characteristics to inform the design of \{CD\} information systems for public health.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements or agile methodologies, violating Exclusion Criteria EC3 and EC7.

Agile methods stress early and continuous delivery of software, welcome changing requirements, and value early feedback from customers. Agile methods seek to cut out inefficiency, bureaucracy, and anything that adds no value to a software product. Proponents of agile methods often see software specification and documentation as adding no value, which has led observers to conclude that agile development is nothing but unprincipled hacking, perhaps even an anarchic counter-reaction to bureaucratic, heavyweight software processes that demand ever more intermediate deliverables from developers. The purpose of this panel is to discuss under what circumstances agile methods work and don't work. Some of the key practices of agile methods are: scheduling according to feature priorities, incremental delivery of software, feedback from expert users, emphasis on face-to-face communication, pair development, minimalist design combined with refactoring, test-driven development, automated regression testing, daily integration, self-organizing teams, and periodic tuning of the methods.

The management of an Informative Workspace (IW) is a challenging task as it can involve many different subjects such as team adaptability, continuous reflection, workspace layout, human cognition, usability, etc. Our paper explores the IW management and it is divided in two phases. The first phase describes a data collection performed on 8 agile teams in order to identify valuable aspects on managing an IW based on their experiences. We proposed a series of suggestions to the teams in order to improve their current context using their IW and we gathered the feedbacks. This process leds to a set of seven heuristics for managing an IW. On the second phase, in order to reinforce the heuristics validity, a five point Likert scale survey was applied resulting mostly in positive evaluations. At the end of these two phases, we associate the seven proposed heuristics, when possible, to available considerations on other agile community references.",INCLUDED,"The article is written in English (EC1 not violated).

These phases effectively maps well to any corporate or agile methodology particularly for basic requirements gathering, including business case, product or system requirements gathering, and personas and user scenarios. Rapid \{CD\} can easily supplement the deliverables required for the business analysis and requirements phases of most corporate processes. Paper prototyping is widely accepted as a means of testing design ideas and refining them. However, it should be accomplished with real user cases and not the canned test scenarios of some usability testing. The core of rapid \{CD\} is getting customer data and its implications into the design process and into the minds of designer and developers.

Our focus is to help software engineers manage the evolution of large and complex software systems by offering them effective and efficient ways to query and assess system properties using visual techniques. To this end, we combine several techniques from different domains, as follows. First, we construct an infrastructure that allows generic querying and data mining of different types of software repositories such as \{CVS\} and Subversion. Using this infrastructure, we construct several models of the software source code evolution at different levels of detail, ranging from project and package up to function and code line. Second, we describe a set of views that allow examining the code evolution models at different levels of detail and from different perspectives. We detail three views: the file view shows changes at line level across many versions of a single, or a few, files. The project view shows changes at file level across entire software projects. The decomposition view shows changes at subsystem level across entire projects. We illustrate how the proposed techniques, which we implemented in a fully operational toolset, have been used to answer non-trivial questions on several real-world, industry-size software projects.

Not all software organizations are under this constraint, but the CMMI model offers benefit beyond just a marketing advantage. Agile methods have taken hold in many of the same organizations that stand to gain benefit from CMMI. CMMI adds some stress to the Agile approach by nature of more detailed planning and tracking. Microsoft and other software development organizations have endeavored to automate the more tedious aspects of CMMI, thus making it easier to support agile approaches within more rigid frameworks. The Microsoft Solutions Framework (MSF) initially founded on Microsoft software best practices observed internally and externally has expanded to integrate automated software configuration for team projects.

One characterization of software complexity is the existence of dependency relationship. Moreover, degree of dependency reflects the cohesion and coupling between software elements. Dependencies on design and implementation phase have been proven as important predictors for software bugs. We empirically investigated how requirements dependencies correlate with and predict software integration bugs, which can provide early estimate regarding software quality, therefore facilitate decision making early in the software lifecycle. We conducted network analysis on requirements dependency networks of two commercial software projects. We then performed correlation analysis between network measures (e.g., degree, closeness) and number of bugs. Afterwards, bug prediction models were built using these network measures. Significant correlation is observed between most of our network measures and number of bugs. These network measures can predict the number of bugs with high accuracy and sensitivity. We further identified the significant predictors for bug prediction. Besides, the indication effect of network measures on bug number varies among different types of requirements dependency.

399.0,Excluded,ec3,Agile methods rapidly replacing traditional methods at Nokia: A survey of opinions on agile transformation,"Context Many organizations have started to deploy agile methods, but so far there exist only a few studies on organization-wide transformations. Are agile methods here to stay? Some claim that agile software development methods are in the mainstream adoption phase in the software industry, while others hope that those are a passing fad. The assumption here is that if agile would not provide real improvement, adopters would be eager at first but turn pessimistic after putting it into practice. Objective Despite the growing amount of anecdotal evidence on the success of agile methods across a wide range of different real-life development settings, scientific studies remain scarce. Even less is known about the perception of the impacts of agile transformation when it is deployed in a very large software development environment, and whether agile methods are here to stay. This study aims to fill that gap by providing evidence from a large-scale agile transformation within Nokia. While we have yet to confirm these findings with solid quantitative data, we believe that the perception of the impacts already pinpoints the direction of the impacts of large-scale agile transformation. Method The data were collected using a questionnaire. The population of the study contains more than 1000 respondents in seven different countries in Europe, North America, and Asia. Results The results reveal that most respondents agree on all accounts with the generally claimed benefits of agile methods. These benefits include higher satisfaction, a feeling of effectiveness, increased quality and transparency, increased autonomy and happiness, and earlier detection of defects. Finally, 60% of respondents would not like to return to the old way of working.

1522.0,Excluded,ec3,Interaction Design in an Engineering-Centric World,"Publisher Summary It is hard to imagine any design training that doesn't include process as a significant part of the studio experience. Put simply, process drives repeatabilityâ€”reducing the reliance on inspirationâ€”and creates a framework in which creative professionals can execute. Developers and engineers are also familiar with the use of process as a framework in which to increase the odds of repeatable results, and most have training and experience using a variety of software development processes. However, most have little experience with the â€œunderstand, design, validate, deliverâ€� sorts of processes frequently applied in design disciplines. Their own experience using a variety of engineering processes creates common ground for the two disciplines, and creates opportunities for setting expectations between the disciplines. In the design process, it is not uncommon to have to return to previous phases. Particularly in environments where clients or executives have the vision themselves to recognize that designers are not on a path to success, it is not uncommon to return to gather broader understanding about a domain, or competitors, or influences.

Over the last 10 years, much has become known about what causes \{IT\} projects to fail. However, there is still very little empirical evidence that this knowledge is actually used in projects for managing risks in \{IT\} projects.

On the contrary, modern development lifecycles call for agileincremental and iterativeapproaches to tame the boosting complexity of modern software systems and reduce development risks. We focus here on requirements verification performed in the early exploratory stages on high-level models and we discuss how this can be integrated into an agile approach. We present a new technique to model-check incomplete high-level specifications against formally specified requirements. We do this in the context of incomplete hierarchical Statecharts, verified against a variation of CTL properties. Our approach supports step-wise specification and refinement verification. Verification can be incremental, that is alternative refinements may be separately explored and verification is only replayed for the modified parts. The results are presented by introducing the formalisms, the model-checking algorithm, and the tool we have implemented.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses requirements verification in the context of agile, incremental, and iterative software development, specifically focusing on high-level models and their refinement.

1752.0,Excluded,ec7,Non-functional requirements in business process modeling,"Business process modeling entails the capture of a set of tasks that invariably model the functional behavior of a system. Another aspect of business process modeling involves the accurate capture of operational behavior and the associated process constraints. Whether the process is automated or manual, such operational constraints and behavior exist. This may include a variety of properties including performance expectations, policy constraints, and security controls. These characteristics later manifest as the non-functional requirements of an intended system, and often such information is generally identified at some point after the business process modeling exercise. The non-functional characteristics of the business are arguably more difficult to capture in business process modeling, since the focus of such methods is the modeling of functional behavior. We propose how two new artifacts may be applied to model the constraints associated with a business process. This is the operating condition to denote a business process constraint and the control case to define controlling criteria to mitigate risk associated with an operational condition. Modeling constraints in this way provides an opportunity to capture these characteristics of business process early in the systems development life-cycle. This contributes to a model that provides a more complete representation of the overall business process. The methods will assist in mitigating risk and facilitate the early discovery of non-functional requirements during systems development.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements or agile methodologies, violating Exclusion Criteria EC3 and EC7.

Two main processes are to be established: creating a reusable infrastructure, and utilizing it for developing products. In practice, these two processes cannot strictly be separated as product enhancements are requested frequently by customers and a changeable infrastructure is essential to react on market needs. Thus, various approaches, such as proactive, reactive, or agile, have been introduced to handle changes. At a finer level of granularity, however, changes comprise many activities with variable duration and thus result in sets of concurrent and overlapping software development activities. This paper, therefore, investigates changes in more detail and assumes that provisioning comprehensive information on changes and respective states are crucial to organizations for keeping a software product line manageable.

2419.0,Excluded,ec5,The agile approach in an undergraduate software engineering course project,"The rise in popularity of agile software development methodologies such as extreme programming (XP), crystal, DSDM and feature-driven development has opened an opportunity for the software engineering education community. How can one capitalize on the strengths of agile development models while still appealing to established software engineering practices? The typical introductory software engineering course makes use of a team-based project to reinforce software process activities. The project normally runs for one academic term during which students are led through life-cycle activities using a modified waterfall approach to software development. While useful in teaching software engineering process concepts, this approach limits the team's ability to utilize feedback from downstream process activities. It also limits the students' opportunity to understand process improvement from their own experiences. The ability to respond to project change is also dampened by the fact that teams do not have the time or resources in this format to modify, or refactor the design of a project component let alone incorporate a new or modified customer requirement. Agile methodologies promote an evolutionary approach to development using short incremental release cycles. We report on the experiences of conducting a team project in an introductory software engineering course using agile development techniques at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Teams have the opportunity to experience multiple iterations of the software engineering life cycle and evolve a product design that allows for discoveries made during implementation and through the introduction of changing customer requirements. The project integrates the concept of test-driven development. This agile technique addresses testing early in the development process and reinforces the value of unit testing.

952.0,Excluded,ec3,Context-awareness: exploring the imperative shared context of security and ubiquitous computing,"Context-awareness is a quintessential feature of ubiquitous computing. Contextual information not only facilitates improved applications, but can also become significant security parameters -- which in turn can potentially ensure service delivery not to anyone anytime anywhere, but to the right person at the right time and place. Specially, in determining access control to resources, contextual information can play an important role. Access control models, as studied in traditional computing security, however, have no notion of context-awareness; and the recent works in the nascent field of context-aware access control predominantly focus on spatio-temporal contexts, disregarding a host of other pertinent contexts. In this paper, with a view to exploring the relationship of access control and context-awareness in ubiquitous computing, we propose a comprehensive context-aware access control model for ubiquitous healthcare services. We explain the design, implementation and evaluation of the proposed model in detail.

However, these models have some problems to be used with XP because of less number of process artifacts produced by agile processes.

Using XP with six sigma can provide means of analyzing XP data and systematically improve process performance.

83.0,Included,included,A comparative case study on clients participation in a 'traditional' and in an Agile software company,"Agile literature suggests that the active and continuous participation and involvement of the clients throughout the project is key to building the right product and raise users' satisfaction. However, relatively little research has been made on comparing what makes clients happy in 'traditional' companies that use planed-driven processes and in agile companies. In turn, it's hard to collect and evaluate evidence in favor of either settings. This paper fills in this gap and compares two software development companies in a Nord-European country in respect to client participation and its impact on the clients' satisfaction with the project. One of the companies is agile by its design while the other follows a 'traditional' software development approach. Our study suggests that active clients' participation is not an exclusive attribute of agile projects and that it can be successfully integrated (and implemented) in a 'traditional' project as well. Further, the study shows that by involving clients, software companies have the chance to get higher customer satisfaction, regardless whether or not they implement agile software development processes.

As business processes are assumed to fulfil organizational goals, goal models could be transformed into business process models that specify how business processes fulfil the organizational goals. Although both the fields of Goal-Oriented RE (GORE) and Business Process Management (BPM) received a lot of attention from researchers, the methods to transform goal models into business process models still need further research. This scientific evaluation paper analyses current methods to identify the practical challenges that need to be addressed for an effective transformation of goal models into business process models. We illustrate the discovered challenges using the case study of Seven-Eleven Japan. The main challenges that were discovered are a lack of responsible role, insufficient concept mappings, informality of the transformation algorithm, no full support for organisational structure and a lack of inter-model consistency checks. Our expected contribution of discovering these challenges is to lower the barriers of transferring new goal-to-process methods to industry.

The team could have postponed the \{UI\} evaluations but instead chose to try to take full advantage of the test participants already scheduled and to conduct a hybrid method wherein they, in parallel, gathered user requirements information and evaluated the \{UI\} prototype. They selected the pluralistic usability \{WT\} as their evaluation method, both because it allowed them to collect data from a number of these valuable and hard-to-schedule users at the same time and that it would allow for a dialogue between these representative users and the product developers, thus speeding up the back-and-forth that was necessary if they were to be engaged in an iterative design process. The team added a requirements-gathering exercise onto the front of the pluralistic usability \{WT\} to collect user requirements data before biasing the pluralistic usability \{WT\} participants with the \{UI\} prototype.

Unpredictable workloads, however, aggravate the semantic gap between the virtual machine monitor and guest operating systems, leading to inefficient resource management. In particular, \{CPU\} management for virtual machines has a critical impact on I/O performance in cases where the virtual machine monitor is agnostic about the internal workloads of each virtual machine. This paper presents virtual machine scheduling techniques for transparently bridging the semantic gap that is a result of consolidated workloads. To enable us to achieve this goal, we ensure that the virtual machine monitor is aware of task-level I/O-boundedness inside a virtual machine using inference techniques, thereby improving I/O performance without compromising \{CPU\} fairness. In addition, we address performance anomalies arising from the indirect use of I/O devices via a driver virtual machine at the scheduling level.

Lean software development propagates two important principles that help process improvement, namely identification of waste in the process and considering interactions between the individual parts of the software process from an end-to-end perspective. A large shift of thinking about the own way of working is often required to adopt lean. One of the potential main sources of failure is to try to make a too large shift about the ways of working at once. Therefore, the change to lean has to be done in a continuous and incremental way.

Quality standards like ISO/IEC-12207 provide a guideline for structuring of development work and improving process and product quality. A considerable number of tools has emerged supporting and automating parts of development work. On \{W7X\} progress has been made during the last years in exploiting the benefit of automation and management during software development:â€“ Continuous build, integration and automated test of software artefacts.âˆ˜ Syntax checks and code quality metrics. âˆ˜ Documentation generation. âˆ˜ Feedback for developers by temporal statistics. â€“ Versioned repository for build products (libraries, executables). â€“ Separate snapshot and release repositories and automatic deployment. â€“ Semi-automatic provisioning of applications. â€“ Feedback from testers and feature requests by ticket system. This toolset is working efficiently and allows the team to concentrate on development. The activity there is presently focused on increasing the quality of the existing software to become a dependable product. Testing of single functions and qualities must be simplified. So a restructuring is underway which relies more on small, individually testable components with standardized interfaces providing the capability to construct arbitrary function aggregates for dedicated tests of quality attributes as availability, reliability, performance. A further activity is on improving the development cycle. The use of release cycles has already provided favourable concentration of work and predictability of delivery times.

Software developers often do not like to create documentation because it has few value to the individual himself.

Documentation increases development speed, reduces software maintenance costs, helps to keep development on track, and mitigates the negative effects of distance in distributed settings. This research aims to increase the individuals' motivation to write documentation by means of reputation. The CollabReview prototype is a web-based reputation system that analyzes artifacts of internal documentation to derive personal reputation scores. Developers making many good contributions will achieve higher reputation scores. These scores can then be employed to softly influence developer behavior, e.g. by incentivizing them to contribute to documentation with social rewards.

652.0,Included,included,Balancing agile and structured development approaches to successfully manage large distributed software projects: A case study from the cruise line industry,"Agile methods and traditional structured approaches are often viewed as competing bi-polar choices. Agile methods such as Scrum and XP are recommended for small, co-located projects that involve changing requirements. The traditional structured plan-driven approaches, such as the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and the waterfall lifecycle frameworks, are recommended for large projects with stable requirements. If a project is large, strategically important, distributed, and has dynamic user requirements and organizational changes, it presents unique challenges that neither the agile methods nor the traditional structured approaches can effectively deal with alone. Although there is an increasing call for a balanced approach, there is little empirical research that shows when and how the two approaches can complement each other. Based on a case study from the cruise line industry of a large distributed strategic project with unanticipated changes, we conclude that this balance is not only workable, but is essential to ensure that the project demonstrates both control and agility for achieving its challenging and dynamic goals. Agile without structure can cause chaos, particularly in large complex distributed projects where planning, control, and coordination are critical. Structure without agility can lead to rigidity, particularly when a project involves a great deal of learning, discovery, and changes.

More specifically, every organization or team implements a customized agile method, tailored to better accommodate its needs. However, the extent to which a customized method supports the organizational objectives, i.e. the `goodness' of that method, is questionable. Existing agile assessment approaches focus on comparative analyses, or are limited in scope and application. In this research, we propose a structured, systematic, and comprehensive approach to assessing the `goodness' of agile methods. We examine an agile method based on (1) its adequacy, (2) the capability of the organization to support the adopted principles and practices specified by the method, and (3) the method's effectiveness. We propose the Objectives, Principles and Practices (OPP) Framework to guide our assessment. The Framework identifies (1) objectives of the agile philosophy, (2) principles that support the objectives, (3) practices that are reflective of the principles, (4) linkages among the objectives, principles and practices, and (5) indicators for assessing the extent to which an organization supports the implementation and the effectiveness of that practice.

A key issue in exploration of object-oriented programs is handling the program state, in particular the heap. Previous research has focused on standard program execution that operates on one state/heap. We present Delta Execution, a technique that simultaneously operates on several states/heaps. It exploits the fact that many execution paths in state-space exploration partially overlap and speeds up the exploration by sharing the common parts across the executions and separately executing only the ""deltas"" where the executions differ. We have implemented Delta Execution in JPF, a popular general-purpose model checker for Java programs, and in BOX, a specialized model checker that we have developed for efficient exploration of sequential Java programs. We have evaluated Delta Execution for (bounded) exhaustive exploration of ten basic subject programs without errors. The experimental results show that on average Delta Execution improves the exploration time 10.97x (over an order of magnitude) in JPF and 2.07x in BOX.

However, these findings might not be applicable in all situations pertaining to scientific software development projects. In addition, they only constitute a subset of the important factors while deciding which development methods and practices should be adopted. Therefore, it becomes important to conduct further research before making recommendations regarding the adoption of certain development methods and practices in this domain. In this progress report, we discuss our on-going research that will empirically study the characteristics of various scientific software development projects according to a model suggested by Boehm and Turner. We plan to conduct interviews and collect data from various scientific software development projects in the Baltimore-Washington area. We expect that our qualitative results will increase our understanding of the characteristics in those projects favoring plan-driven approaches or agile methods, and the needs and conditions associated with those characteristics. Our research provides guidance to scientific software developers by enhancing their capacity to evaluate and understand their own project characteristics and select effective software practices.

422.0,Included,included,Agile product line planning: A collaborative approach and a case study,"Agile methods and product line engineering (PLE) have both proven successful in increasing customer satisfaction and decreasing time to market under certain conditions. Key characteristics of agile methods are lean and highly iterative development with a strong emphasis on stakeholder involvement. \{PLE\} leverages reuse through systematic approaches such as variability modeling or product derivation. Integrating agile approaches with product line engineering is an interesting proposition which â€“ not surprisingly â€“ entails several challenges: Product lines (PL) rely on complex plans and models to ensure their long-term evolution while agile methods emphasize simplicity and short-term value-creation for customers. When incorporating agility in product line engineering, it is thus essential to define carefully how agile principles can support particular \{PLE\} processes. For instance, the processes of defining and setting up a product line (domain engineering) and deriving products (application engineering) differ significantly in practices and focus with implications on the suitability of agile principles. This paper presents practical experiences of adopting agile principles in product line planning (a domain engineering activity). ThinkLets, i.e., collaborative practices from the area of collaboration engineering, are the building blocks of the presented approach as they codify agile principles such as stakeholder involvement, rapid feedback, or value-based prioritization.

217.0,Included,included,A scrum-based approach to CMMI maturity level 2 in web development environments,"Scrum has become one of the most popular agile methodologies, either alone or combined with other agile practices. Besides, CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration) is accepted as a suitable model to measure the maturity of the organizations when developing or acquiring software. Although these two approaches are often considered antagonist, the use of an agile approach to reach certain CMMI maturity levels may result beneficial to organizations that develop Web systems, since they would take the advantages of both approaches. In Web community, this union may be very interesting, because agile approaches fits with the special needs of Web development, and they could be a useful tool for companies getting a certain grade of maturity. This work analyzes the goals of CMMI maturity level 2 and the feasibility of achieving them using the practices proposed by Scrum, trying to assess whether the use of this methodology is suitable for meeting the CMMI generic and specific goals or not.

1664.0,Excluded,ec3,Mechatronics of active vision,"Machine vision suffers from fundamental difficulties in terms of algorithm complexity and methodological approaches in finding solutions to basic problems. The active vision paradigm is an effort to address these issues by enabling the seeing agent to manipulate its visual parameters in time and space so as to simplify its computational tasks and solve for the ambiguities in the process of visual perception. In this paper it is argued that if the goal of research in computational vision is considered to be that of understanding and designing seeing systems, then we need a design strategy. In our particular case, the design strategy has been influenced by anthropomorphic qualities. The empirical nature of such research also requires systems by which one can perform experiments in real-time and in interaction with the environment. This criterion has also been an important guide-line in the design of the system. The need for the manipulation of the visual parameters is a typical application of mechatronicsâ€”the interaction between the mechanics and electronicsâ€” of a complex perceptual system. By an analysis based on observations from the primate visual system, we describe the design of such a system. Details of its implementation and performance are also provided. To demonstrate that the system meets the requirements derived from our analysis, we finally describe a set of experiments with the designed robot head involving gaze control and the integration of a set of primary ocular processes.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements in software projects using agile methodologies (violates EC3).

The case is told by the consultant who initiated implementation of agility into requirements gathering, estimation and planning processes in an international setting. The agile approach was inspired by XP, but then tailored to meet the peculiar requirements. Two innovations were critical. The first innovation was promiscuous pair story authoring, where user stories were written by two people (similarly to pair programming), and the pairing changed very often (as frequently as every 15-20 minutes) to achieve promiscuity and cater for diverse point of views. The second innovation was an economic value evaluation (and not the cost) which was attributed to stories. Continuous recalculation of the financial value of the stories allowed to assess the projects financial return.

Several reports from large companies such as Bosch, Nokia, Philips and Siemens witness gains and benefits achieved with their use, especially with respect to the reduction on time to market. In SPL development, domain analysis plays a central role where the relevant features are identified. Feature-Oriented Domain Analysis is a method which uses a feature model to specify variabilities and commonalities of an SPL. However, activities related to the Domain Analysis process (managing commonalities and variabilities, with users visibility and relevant stakeholders) in most cases, do not seem to be a simple and easy activity, since to represent these analyzes in modelling domain tools with a certain degree of formality, requires a technical knowledge that domain experts do not always have it prior to use. But creative requirements techniques have been suggested to facilitate the elicitation activity by filling the gap the communications problems between domain experts and software engineers, making the domain analysis more agile. Thus, to improve the domain analysis process, this paper seeks to set out the use of a creative and agile technique for modelling requirements by means of mind maps for cognitive and effective support when building feature models.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address at least one agile methodology (as per EC7), as it focuses on creative requirements techniques and mind maps for feature modeling without explicitly addressing a specific agile methodology.

In some cases, requirements analysts or involved stakeholders do not fully understand the requirements that other disciplines impose, and thus fail to deliver a requirements specification that can be used in interdisciplinary development teams. In requirements engineering, requirement patterns are used to recognize important and recurring issues, thus reducing the effort of compiling a list of software requirements. The objective of the proposed dissertation project is to develop a similar pattern based approach that helps in analysing requirements from different disciplines and making them comprehensible for all stakeholders who need to agree to a requirement specification as the deliverable of requirements engineering. Due to the importance of legal aspects for, and users' trust in, socio-technical systems, requirement patterns will be developed for these two aspects. For the legal requirement patterns, legal requirements that are stable concerning changes due to their origin in fundamental, higher-ranked laws will be collected, and requirement patterns will be derived from them. For the requirement patterns for trust support, antecedents that build trust will be collected, and requirement patterns that demand functionality to support these antecedents will be developed. The obtained patterns are then used to compile a requirement list that serves as input for requirements negotiation with the various stakeholders.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements specifically; instead, it focuses on socio-technical systems and multidisciplinary requirements, particularly legal and trust-related aspects.

STS supports multiple idioms of specification : transitions, state-diagrams, scenarios etc. It also supports constructs for hierarchical organization of a specification. We have further defined analyses that are useful for review and inspection of STS specifications. A distinctive feature of our method is the ability to use analysis results to refine and reinforce parts of the specification by importing analysis results into STS specifications.

Evolutionary software development represents an alternative to plan-driven development in order to tackle today's turbulent environments. In agile development, a type of evolutionary development, the product owner (P.O.) who is the customer representative---real accountable role---is ill-equipped to identify and prioritize the stakeholders' most success-critical expectations and potential sources of business value. Furthermore, the tools he can use have their own scalability issues that question their underlying principles. Moreover, without a substantial involvement to take into account all stakeholders, software providers are more likely acting as commodity-utility providers than real business partners. In today's business context, there is a clear need for a value-driven development which embraces changes along with higher visibility and understanding of business transformations.
The current problems of software crisis could be condensed in a twofold business perspective dilemma: Doing the right product and providing efficient guidance to the development project. Approaches based on goals have been successfully used in Requirements Engineering (RE) and IT governance to address issues similar to the current software crisis. Commonalities in motivations behind the use of goals in both domains can open new avenues for improving the business perspective in Scrum.

341.0,Included,included,Adopting key lessons from agile manufacturing to agile software product development-A comparative study,"Many industrial new product development (NPD) software projects apply nowadays agile methodologies. These methodologies, such as Scrum, eXtreme Programming (XP), and Feature-Driven Development (FDD) date back to 1990s, and the Agile Manifesto was declared in 2001. However, already before that the concept of agile manufacturing (AM) was discovered to describe a corporate ability for quick adaptation to changing requirements. There is surprising amount in common between these two fields. This raises a question of whether NPD software development companies could take even more overall advantage of those different agile approaches. This interdisciplinary paper explores the commonalities between the key concepts of AM and some of the most popular agile software methods, and consequently suggests potential new areas for software process improvement (SPI) in large-scale NPD organizations. An industrial case example illustrates how agility in embedded software product development can be enhanced by following typical NPD principles. We conclude that there is potential for further improvements in software product development industry in general by seeing agility as a wider, organization-oriented business concept following the AM/NPD learning.

To meet these changing requirements, software developers have developed agile software development methodologies (SDMs) utilizing iterative development, prototyping, and templates. This research project investigated agile SDM implementation using an online survey sent to practitioners worldwide. This survey data were used to identify factors related to agile SDM implementation. Factors that included training, management involvement, access to external resources, and corporate size were found to impact implementation of an agile software development methodology. Factors such as using models, having an implementation plan, collocating the development team, and developing software for Internet or intranet use did not impact the implementation of an agile software development methodology.

However, little is known about this social activity or how communication and collaboration supports requirements activities in this setting. This paper reports an empirical study of a commercial agile team to investigate this issue.

We were interested in studying collaboration in agile teams including interaction designers, since the integration of user interaction design processes and software development processes is still an open issue. This study focused on designer and developer collaborations in the early stages of project work at four workplaces. We found designer-developer collaborations were extensive and we developed a categorization scheme of collaboration forms and artefacts that support this relationship. While some designer-developer collaborations were directed towards planning, which has been extensively researched, a larger part was directed towards realignment work. This latter type of collaborative work took three basic forms: scheduled, impromptu, and chats. Regardless of the form of collaboration, designer-developer interactions were mediated by twelve categories of artefacts. These artefacts helped designers and developers to determine, more specifically, what to create.

This shift in perspective has gone relatively unnoticed by current software engineering research. This paper offers a glimpse at what processes and instruments lie beyond “current” software engineering research, where studying emergent DyNOs, their creation and steering becomes critical. To understand the underpinnings of this evolution, we explored a simple yet vivid scenario from real-life industrial practice. Using scenario analysis we elicited a number of social and organizational requirements in working with DyNOs. Also, comparing our evidence with literature, we made some key observations.

2769.0,Excluded,ec3,Variance of the throughput of an N-station production line with no intermediate buffers and time dependent failures,"In this study, the variance of the throughput of an N-station production line with no intermediate buffers and time dependent failures is analytically determined. Time to failure and time to repair distributions are assumed to be exponential. The analytical method yields a closed-form expression for the variance of the throughput. The method is based on determining the limiting variance of the total residence (sojourn) time in a specific state of an irreducible recurrent Markov process from the probability of visiting that state at time t given an initial state. This probability function is the instantaneous availability of a production system in the reliability context. A production line with no interstation buffers and time-dependent failures is basically a series system with hot standby. The same procedure can be applied to determine the variance of the throughputs of various arrangements of workstations including series, parallel, series-parallel systems provided that the instantaneous availabilities of these systems can be written explicitly. Numerical experiments show that, although the expected throughput decreases monotonically, the variance of the throughput may increase and then decrease as the number of stations in the line increases depending on the system parameters.

1846.0,Included,included,PIP: a product planning strategy for the whole family or... how we became the brady bunch,"As a small start-up company with a heavyweight client list, Sabrix found itself at a critical crossroads in its growth in the Spring of 2003. We were consuming all product development resources satisfying commitments made to existing customers, which seriously limited our ability to react to new requirements and improve our competitive edge in the market. In the face of this resource strain, we needed to add a series of smaller, plug-in type products to our existing offering. Of course, this environment required 100% focus on day-to-day tasks and tactical issues, leaving no time or energy for looking ahead. Compounding these problems were the same issues that every company faces. A lack of trust between functional groups, with Product Development on one side and Sales and Support on the other; and, very few people in the company knew what work was being done in Product Development. When stepping back from the situation, we realized that all of the problems could be grouped into three general categories - prioritization, collaboration and visibility. To improve each of these areas, we developed the Product Input and Planning (PIP) process. PIP is a cross-functional, cross-product way of building a roadmap by prioritizing work, balancing competitiveness and customer-driven requirements, and improving product-related communication in all directions within the company. The PIP Team is responsible for prioritizing and building an 18-month roadmap, focusing on the future direction of the company, while Product Management and Product Development focus on delivering the current releases. This paper is not what one would call a success story, though it unquestionably has a moral. The PIP process as described herein exists no longer. Several factors contributed to its morphing into a different kind of family. The lessons learned over the course of the lifetime of PIP, however, are applicable to almost any large-scale, cross-functional endeavor.",EXCLUDED,"The article is a narrative case study that describes an internal process (PIP) developed by a company to address prioritization, collaboration, and visibility issues in product planning.

1805.0,Excluded,ec3,Operational definition and automated inference of test-driven development with Zorro,"Test-driven development (TDD) is a style of development named for its most visible characteristic: the design and implementation of test cases prior to the implementation of the code required to make them pass. Many claims have been made for TDD: that it can improve implementation as well as design quality, that it can improve productivity, that it results in 100% coverage, and so forth. However, research to validate these claims has yielded mixed and sometimes contradictory results. We believe that at least part of the reason for these results stems from differing interpretations of the TDD development style, along with an inability to determine whether programmers actually follow whatever definition of TDD is in use. Zorro is a system designed to automatically determine whether a developer is complying with an operational definition of Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices. Automated recognition of TDD can benefit the software development community in a variety of ways, from inquiry into the “true nature” of TDD, to pedagogical aids to support the practice of test-driven development, to support for more rigorous empirical studies on the effectiveness of TDD in both laboratory and real world settings. This paper describes the Zorro system, its operational definition of TDD, the analyses made possible by Zorro, two empirical evaluations of the system, and an attempted case study. Our research shows that it is possible to define an operational definition of TDD that is amenable to automated recognition, and illustrates the architectural and design issues that must be addressed in order to do so.

632.0,Included,included,Automated error analysis for the agilization of feature modeling,"Software Product Lines (SPL) and agile methods share the common goal of rapidly developing high-quality software. Although they follow different approaches to achieve it, some synergies can be found between them by (i) applying agile techniques to \{SPL\} activities so \{SPL\} development becomes more agile; and (ii) tailoring agile methodologies to support the development of SPL. Both options require an intensive use of feature models, which are usually strongly affected by changes on requirements. Changing large-scale feature models as a consequence of changes on requirements is a well-known error-prone activity. Since one of the objectives of agile methods is a rapid response to changes in requirements, it is essential an automated error analysis support in order to make \{SPL\} development more agile and to produce error-free feature models. As a contribution to find the intended synergies, this article sets the basis to provide an automated support to feature model error analysis by means of a framework which is organized in three levels: a feature model level, where the problem of error treatment is described; a diagnosis level, where an abstract solution that relies on Reiterâ€™s theory of diagnosis is proposed; and an implementation level, where the abstract solution is implemented by using Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP). To show an application of our proposal, a real case study is presented where the Feature-Driven Development (FDD) methodology is adapted to develop an SPL. Current proposals on error analysis are also studied and a comparison among them and our proposal is provided. Lastly, the support of new kinds of errors and different implementation levels for the proposed framework are proposed as the focus of our future work.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements in software projects using agile methodologies, specifically focusing on the agilization of feature modeling in Software Product Lines (SPL).

2244.0,Included,included,Software quality and assurance in waterfall model and XP - A comparative study,"Dealing with an increasingly volatile organizational environment is a serious challenge for managers of any software development. Traditional formal software development methodologies can be characterized as reflecting linear, sequential processes, and the related management approaches, and be effective in development software with stable, known, consistent requirements. Yet most real-world development efforts are much more likely to be conducted in more volatile environments, as organizations adapt to changing technology, markets, and social conditions. Requirements for systems must be able to change right along with them, often at ""Internet speed"" [1]. Project management approaches based on the traditional linear development methodologies are mismatched with such dynamic systems. The support of software quality in a software development process may be regarded under two aspects: first, by providing techniques, which support the development of high quality software and second, by providing techniques, which assure the required quality attributes in existing artifacts. Both approaches have to be combined to achieve effective and successful software engineering [2]. Agile methods may produce software faster but we also need to know how they meet our quality requirements. In this paper we compare the waterfall model with agile processes to show how agile methods achieve software quality under time pressure and in an unstable requirements environment, i.e. we analyze agile software quality assurance. We present a detailed waterfall model showing its software quality support processes. We then show the quality practices that agile methods have integrated into their processes.

Results We discovered that Lack of Customer Involvement was one of the biggest challenges faced by Agile teams. Customers were not as involved on these Agile projects as Agile methods demand. We describe the causes of inadequate customer collaboration, its adverse consequences on self-organizing Agile teams, and Agile Undercover â€” a set of strategies used by the teams to practice Agile despite insufficient or ineffective customer involvement.

1619.0,Excluded,ec3,Locking the door but leaving the computer vulnerable: Factors inhibiting home users' adoption of software firewalls,"In the new era of a ubiquitously networked world, security measures are only as good as their weakest link. Home computers with access to the Internet are one of the weaker links as they are typically not as well protected as computers in the corporate world. Malicious actors can not only target such computers but also use them to launch attacks against other systems connected to the Internet, thus posing severe threats to data and infrastructure as well as disrupting electronic commerce. This paper investigates the factors that affect the use of security protection strategies by home computer users in relation to a specific, but crucial security technology for home â€“ a software firewall. This paper proposes individuals' concern for privacy, awareness of common security measures, attitude towards security and privacy protection technologies, and computer anxiety as important antecedents that have an impact on the users' decision to adopt a software firewall. The results of our study suggest that attitude plays a more important role than perceived usefulness in shaping users' intention to use firewalls. We attribute this interesting finding to the non-functional nature of firewall systems that work best in the background with a complex relationship to users' productivity. Hence, the results add to our current understanding of Technology Acceptance Model vis-Ã -vis technologies that serve non-functional needs such as security. We then present a set of guidelines to home computer users, Internet Service Providers, e-commerce companies, and the government to increase home users' adoption rate of privacy and security protection technologies.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements in the context of software projects using agile methodologies (violates EC3).

49.0,Excluded,ec3,4 - Infrastructure and Security,"Publisher Summary Infrastructure refers to those resources and items required to successfully support and operate information systems. Security refers to policies, procedures, software, and hardware designed to insure that data in information systems are protected against accidental or inappropriate destruction, alteration, or access. Properly supported, infrastructure competency allows an organization to maintain agility in responding to strategic directives and tactical changes. Infrastructure and security together provide the day-to-day operational support for the hardware and software, thus forming a critical component of the organization. Proper management of security requires attention to infrastructure and information system designs, as well as the organization adhering to strict and appropriate personnel practices. Both infrastructure and security are among the many invisible processes and resources required to implement and sustain a successful clinical computing system. Some resources, such as a data center, must be available prior to implementation of these systems; many other resources, such as those supporting security, should be available prior to implementation, but are often deferred until problems occur. Most infrastructure requirements continue and expand after the system is in use. Although organizations can purchase services through outside contracted vendors, those developing skills in their own personnel can use resources more cost effectively, saving as much as 25â€“40%, particularly in areas such as disaster management. In the longer term, the use of contracted services can result in the loss of skills necessary for making strategic decisions, putting into question whether the estimated savings of contracting can be achieved.",EXCLUDED,The article does not address software requirements as it focuses on infrastructure and security rather than software project requirements.

936.0,Included,included,Comparison between adaptive software development and feature driven development,"Agile methods gain the upper hand over traditional software development methods when it comes to constant customer participation, customer satisfaction with early project delivery and acceptance of requirement changes at any stage of software development life cycle. So the practice of agile methods has been increasing in recent years. Some of the well-known agile methods that are in practice today are Adaptive Software Development, Feature Driven Development, Scrum, eXtreme Programming. A comparison among different agile methods helps managers who need to introduce agility into their organization by providing a thorough knowledge on different features and aspects of the agile methods. By comparing different agile methods, managers can easily choose the agile method that best suites his project requirements and organizational characteristics. Different comparison techniques to compare agile methods were introduced in recent years by researchers. We have compared the agile methods Adaptive Software Development and Feature Driven Development in order to evaluate their degree of agility and coverage degree with respect to the two Knowledge Areas of SWEBOK, (1) Software Requirements, (2) Software Construction. The result of our comparison shows that Adaptive Software Development mainly differs from Feature Driven Development because there are no predefined techniques or specific practices that are meant to be followed in Adaptive Software Development. Feature Driven Development has some predefined techniques or practices that are to be followed during software development. The principle of Adaptive Software Development is to focus more on results rather than steps to achieve that result. A technique is only implemented if it is necessary to get the best output in Adaptive Software Development.

Objective This case study provides a comprehensive taxonomy of the challenges faced when a medium-scale organization decided to adopt software platforms. The study also reveals how new trends in software engineering (i.e. agile methods, distributed development, and flat management structures) interplayed with the chosen platform strategy. Method We used an ethnographic approach to collect data by spending time at a medium-scale company in Scandinavia. We conducted 16&#xa0;in-depth interviews with representatives of eight different teams, three of which were working on three separate platforms. The collected data was analyzed using Grounded Theory. Results The findings identify four classes of challenges, namely: business challenges, organizational challenges, technical challenges, and people challenges. The article explains how these findings can be used to help researchers and practitioners identify practical solutions and required tool support. Conclusion The organizationâ€™s decision to adopt a software platform strategy introduced a number of challenges. These challenges need to be understood and addressed in order to reap the benefits of reuse.

2070.0,Included,included,Requirements Reviews Revisited: Residual Challenges and Open Research Questions," It is widely accepted that early reviews on requirements specifications (RS) are an effective and efficient quality assurance technique. So why are they still not applied all over the software industry? In this paper we pinpoint that this is due to five major challenges: 1) Software requirements are based on flawed `upstream' requirements and reviews on RS are thus in vain. 2) The impact of sociological issues related to reviews is underestimated. 3) Important quality aspects of RS escape reviews. 4) The goal of applying reviews is not made clear and different review approaches are mixed. 5) Incremental software development poses specific challenges to applying reviews on RS. In this paper we argue that in order to solve these five challenges research on reviews must take a more holistic approach, stretching to pre-project phases and incorporating various other disciplines in order to add more value for the software industry.

XP proposes many interesting practices, but it also has some weaknesses. From the software engineering point of view the most important issues are: maintenance problems resulting from very limited documentation (XP relies on code and test cases only), and lack of wider perspective of a system to be built. Moreover, XP assumes that there is only one customer representative. In many cases there are several representatives (each one with his own view of the system and different priorities) and then some XP practices should be modified. In the paper we assess XP from two points of view: the capability maturity model and the Sommerville-Sawyer model (1997).

1980.0,Excluded,ec7,Quantifying requirements volatility effects,"In an organization operating in the bancassurance sector we identified a low-risk \{IT\} subportfolio of 84 \{IT\} projects comprising together 16,500 function points, each project varying in size and duration, for which we were able to quantify its requirements volatility. This representative portfolio stems from a much larger portfolio of \{IT\} projects. We calculated the volatility from the function point countings that were available to us. These figures were aggregated into a requirements volatility benchmark. We found that maximum requirements volatility rates depend on size and duration, which refutes currently known industrial averages. For instance, a monthly growth rate of 5% is considered a critical failure factor, but in our low-risk portfolio we found more than 21% of successful projects with a volatility larger than 5%. We proposed a mathematical model taking size and duration into account that provides a maximum healthy volatility rate that is more in line with the reality of low-risk \{IT\} portfolios. Based on the model, we proposed a tolerance factor expressing the maximal volatility tolerance for a project or portfolio. For a low-risk portfolio its empirically found tolerance is apparently acceptable, and values exceeding this tolerance are used to trigger \{IT\} decision makers. We derived two volatility ratios from this model, the Ï€ -ratio and the Ï� -ratio. These ratios express how close the volatility of a project has approached the danger zone when requirements volatility reaches a critical failure rate. The volatility data of a governmental \{IT\} portfolio were juxtaposed to our bancassurance benchmark, immediately exposing a problematic project, which was corroborated by its actual failure. When function points are less common, e.g.Â in the embedded industry, we used daily source code size measures and illustrated how to govern the volatility of a software product line of a hardware manufacturer. With the three real-world portfolios we illustrated that our results serve the purpose of an early warning system for projects that are bound to fail due to excessive volatility.

In this paper we investigate alignment between two different documentation practices and agile development. We report upon an experiment conducted to explore the impact of formalism and media type on various dimensions of documentation practice in agile teams. 28 students in 8 teams were divided into two groups: SAD and UML. Group SAD was to update and deliver their high-level software architecture in form of a textual description defined by RUP templates. Group UML was instructed to update and deliver their low-level software design in form of UML models. Our results show that iterative documentation practices led to more extensive and more detailed textual documentation. We found that writing documentation was perceived as a intrusive task leading to task specialization and allocation of documentation to less qualified team members. Consequently, this hampered collaboration within the team. Based in our findings, we suggest that if documentation is to be delivered with the project, producing documentation should be communicated and accepted by the team as a proper product.

589.0,Included,included,Approximation of \{COSMIC\} functional size to support early effort estimation in Agile,"The demands in the software industry of estimating development effort in the early phases of development are met by measuring software size from user requirements. A large number of companies have adapted themselves with Agile processes, which, although, promise rapid software development, pose a huge burden on the development teams for continual decision making and expert judgement, when estimating the size of the software components to be developed at each iteration. COSMIC, on the other hand, is an ISO/IEC international standard that presents an objective method of measuring the functional size of the software from user requirements. However, its measurement process is not compatible with Agile processes, as \{COSMIC\} requires user requirements to be formalised and decomposed at a level of granularity where external interactions with the system are visible to the human measurer. This time-consuming task is avoided by agile processes, leaving it with the only option of quick subjective judgement by human measurers for size measurement that often tends to be erroneous. In this article, we address these issues by presenting an approach to approximate \{COSMIC\} functional size from informally written textual requirements demonstrating its applicability in popular agile processes.

554.0,Excluded,ec3,Analysing computer science students' teamwork role adoption in an online self-organised teamwork activity,"Computer Science (CS) professionals are regularly required to work in teams to solve complex problems. Agile software development processes are increasingly popular in organisations as a method for teamwork but the self-organising nature of the method and lack of strictly allocated roles means that graduates need to know how to adopt and transition between roles effectively. While online teamwork makes team processes and behaviours transparent, educators are often confronted by the amount of data and difficulty in how to judge roles and behaviours to provide meaningful feedback to students. Furthermore, assessment of teamwork does not necessarily ignite a need to identify roles and behaviours as feedback is usually based on the product, rather than processes and behaviours. Using Dickinson and McIntyre's teamwork roles, we extend the framework to include explicit behaviours to analyse one class of students' self-organised team interactions in an online discussion space as solved open-ended problems. The collaborative activity did encourage role adoption, however not all students moved fluidly through the roles. Despite the lack of defined roles, one or two students adopted leadership roles, but attempts at leadership were not always successful. We discovered other less-obvious roles were equally important for maintaining and progressing team discussions. In this paper, we discuss the roles that emerged and suggest strategies for encouraging and assessing online teamwork. Our framework may prove to be a guide for others seeking to analyse students' teamwork and provides a guide for what behaviours a teacher might look for in online environments. Our findings support the need to develop tools that provide real-time visual feedback to students and teachers about student behaviour and roles when undertaking teamwork in online spaces.",EXCLUDED,"The study does not address software requirements and focuses on analyzing teamwork roles in computer science students' online activities, which falls under teaching and educational research rather than software project requirements in agile methodologies.

1305.0,Excluded,ec3,Fully Distributed Scrum: Linear Scalability of Production between San Francisco and India,"The Scrum software development framework was designed for the hyperproductive state where productivity increases by 5-10 times over waterfall teams and many colocated teams have achieved this effect. In 2006, Xebia (The Netherlands) started localized projects with half Dutch and half Indian team members. After establishing a localized velocity of five times their waterfall competitors on the same project, they moved the Indian members of the team to India and showed stable velocity with fully distributed teams. The ability to achieve hyperproductivity with distributed, outsourced teams was shown to be a repeatable process and a fully distributed model is now the recommended standard when organizations have disciplined Scrum teams with full implementation of XP engineering practices inside the Scrum. Previous studies used overlapping time zones to ease communication and create a single distributed team. The goal of this report is to go one step further and show the same results with team members separated by the 12.5 hour time difference between India and San Francisco. If Scrum works without overlapping time zones then applying it to the mainstream offshoring practice in North America will be possible. In 2008, Xebia India started engagements with partners like TBD.com, a social networking site in San Francisco.

Together with the success of the Internet technology, it is often necessary to offer a web-based software solution. For Java development, J2EE builds a bridge from traditional towards web application development. Java Server Pages and Servlets allow the implementation of web sites with dynamic content. Anyway, it is still possible to apply well-tried programming paradigms, e.g. the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm. With regard to software quality as well as adaptability, application development is affected more and more by advanced testing techniques. Especially unit testing provides a powerful technique to develop new functionality as well as to extend and reuse existing parts. This is also strengthened by the success of agile processes that force test-driven development. From there, application code grows up with unit tests from scratch on. For Java, JUnit has become the defacto standard unit test environment. Nevertheless, test-driven web application development requires broadening the unit test approach. Considering the special requirements of web application development, both the scope of the unit tests as well as the JUnit framework itself have to be extended to enable a test-driven development.

1380.0,Included,included,How the Business Analyst supports and encourages collaboration on agile projects,"Agile teams need the Business Analyst (BA) to clearly define and communicate the detailed user stories to ensure a successful product. MITRE's Corporate IT Systems Engineering department supports software development activities which recently adopted an agile methodology. Unlike the detailed requirements documentation of more traditional, waterfall-based projects, we have found the streamlined &#x201C;user stories&#x201D; inadequate for developers or testers. Our BA experiences with eliciting user story details and maintaining the backlog for sprint planning are a critical component to agile development. BA activities include grooming the backlog, documenting user stories with detailed contracts, and performing user story verification through testing. This paper will review the techniques we have used during agile projects to manage the sprint cycle, including templates for user story management. Capturing artifacts from other agile projects and documenting recommended agile process guidelines can help projects be successful through reuse and collaboration. Many agile projects generate artifacts that are lost or are created for the benefit of only their project and discarded when through. Agile encourages lean documentation in order to maximize agility. We established a repository using an internal website where we documented corporte IT processes and share agile templates and samples. This repository includes samples of sprint schedules, backlog lists, burn-down charts, retrospective items, and user stories. The corporate IT process recommends agile but also includes traditional waterfall guidance and correlates the two different approaches. All projects, whether they are agile or otherwise, need similar deliverables, including project schedules and project plans. In correlating agile considerations to a waterfall approach, we hope to ease the transition to agile.

602.0,Included,included,Are you biting off more than you can chew? A case study on causes and effects of overscoping in large-scale software engineering,"Context Scope management is a core part of software release management and often a key factor in releasing successful software products to the market. In a market-driven case, when only a few requirements are known a priori, the risk of overscoping may increase. Objective This paper reports on findings from a case study aimed at understanding overscoping in large-scale, market-driven software development projects, and how agile requirements engineering practices may affect this situation. Method Based on a hypothesis of which factors that may be involved in an overscoping situation, semi-structured interviews were performed with nine practitioners at a large, market-driven software company. The results from the interviews were validated by six (other) practitioners at the case company via a questionnaire. Results The results provide a detailed picture of overscoping as a phenomenon including a number of causes, root causes and effects, and indicate that overscoping is mainly caused by operating in a fast-moving market-driven domain and how this ever-changing inflow of requirements is managed. Weak awareness of overall goals, in combination with low development involvement in early phases, may contribute to â€˜biting offâ€™ more than a project can â€˜chewâ€™. Furthermore, overscoping may lead to a number of potentially serious and expensive consequences, including quality issues, delays and failure to meet customer expectations. Finally, the study indicates that overscoping occurs also when applying agile requirements engineering practices, though the overload is more manageable and perceived to result in less wasted effort when applying a continuous scope prioritization, in combination with gradual requirements detailing and a close cooperation within cross-functional teams. Conclusion The results provide an increased understanding of scoping as a complex and continuous activity, including an analysis of the causes, effects, and a discussion on possible impact of agile requirements engineering practices to the issue of overscoping. The results presented in this paper can be used to identify potential factors to address in order to achieve a more realistic project scope.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements in large-scale software engineering projects using agile practices, specifically focusing on overscoping and agile requirements engineering.

1009.0,Excluded,ec3,Designing and implementing a measurement program for Scrum teams: what do agile developers really need and want?,"Agile developers are generally reluctant to non-agile practices. Promoted by senior software practitioners, agile methods were intended to avoid traditional engineering practices and rather focus on delivering working software as quickly as possible. Thus, the unique measure in Scrum, a well known framework for managing agile projects, is velocity. Its main purpose is to demonstrate the progress in delivering working software. In software engineering (SE), measurement programs have more in depth purposes and allow teams and individuals to improve their development process along with providing better product quality and control over the project. This paper will describe the experience and the approach used in an agile SE company to design and initiate a measurement program taking into account the specificities of their agile environment, principles and values. The lessons learned after five months of investigation are twofold. The first one shows how agile teams, in comparison to traditional teams, have different needs when trying to establish a measurement program. The second confirms that agile teams, as many other groups of workers, are reluctant and resistant to change. Finally, the preliminary results show that agile people are more interested in value delivery, technical debt, and multiple aspects related to team dynamics and will cooperate to the collection of data as soon as there tools can do it for them.

The physical environment of the workspace plays a significant role in effective communication, collaboration, and coordination among people while developing software. Objective In this paper, we have studied and further evaluated empirically the effect of different constituents of physical environment on communication, coordination, and collaboration, respectively. The study aims to provide a guideline for prospective agile software developers. Method A survey was conducted among software developers at a software development organization. To collect data, a survey was carried out along with observations, and interviews. Results It has been found that half cubicles are â€˜very effectiveâ€™ for the frequency of communication. Further, half cubicles were discovered â€˜effectiveâ€™ but not â€˜very effectiveâ€™ for the quality/effectiveness of communication. It is found that half-height cubicles and status boards are â€˜very effectiveâ€™ for the coordination among team members according to the survey. Communal/discussion space is found to be â€˜effectiveâ€™ but not â€˜very effectiveâ€™ for coordination among team members. Our analysis also reveals that half-height glass barriers are â€˜very effectiveâ€™ during the individuals problem-solving activities while working together as a team. Infact, such a physically open environment appears to improve communication, coordination, and collaboration. Conclusion According to this study, an open working environment with only half-height glass barriers and communal space plays a major role in communication among team members. The presence of status boards significantly help in reducing unnecessary communication by providing the required information to individuals and therefore, in turn reduce distractions a team member may confront in their absence. As communication plays a significant role in improving coordination and collaboration, it is not surprising to find the effect of open working environment and status boards in improving coordination and collaboration. An open working environment increases the awareness among software developers e.g. who is doing what, what is on the agenda, what is taking place, etc. That in turn, improves coordination among them. A communal/discussion space helps in collaboration immensely.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements directly; instead, it focuses on the physical ambiance and its impact on communication, collaboration, and coordination in agile software development.
