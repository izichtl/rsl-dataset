A major barrier has been a lack of understanding by system designers of communicable disease (CD) work and the public health workers who perform this work. This study reports on the application of user-centered design representations, traditionally used for improving interface design, to translate the complex \{CD\} work identified through ethnographic studies to guide designers and developers of \{CD\} systems. The purpose of this work is to: (1) better understand public health practitioners and their information workflow with respect to \{CD\} monitoring and control at a local health agency, and (2) to develop evidence-based design representations that model this \{CD\} work to inform the design of future disease surveillance systems. Methods We performed extensive onsite semi-structured interviews, targeted work shadowing and a focus group to characterize local health agency \{CD\} workflow. Informed by principles of design ethnography and user-centered design we created persona, scenarios and user stories to accurately represent the user to system designers. Results We sought to convey to designers the key findings from ethnographic studies: (1) public health \{CD\} work is mobile and episodic, in contrast to current \{CD\} reporting systems, which are stationary and fixed, (2) health agency efforts are focused on \{CD\} investigation and response rather than reporting and (3) current \{CD\} information systems must conform to public health workflow to ensure their usefulness. In an effort to illustrate our findings to designers, we developed three contemporary design-support representations: persona, scenario, and user story. Conclusions Through application of user-centered design principles, we were able to create design representations that illustrate complex public health communicable disease workflow and key user characteristics to inform the design of \{CD\} information systems for public health.",INCLUDED,The article meets all Inclusion Criteria without violating any Exclusion Criteria.

Abstract: Agile methods such as Extreme Programming, Crystal, Scrum, and others have attracted a lot of attention recently. Agile methods stress early and continuous delivery of software, welcome changing requirements, and value early feedback from customers. Agile methods seek to cut out inefficiency, bureaucracy, and anything that adds no value to a software product. Proponents of agile methods often see software specification and documentation as adding no value, which has led observers to conclude that agile development is nothing but unprincipled hacking, perhaps even an anarchic counter-reaction to bureaucratic, heavyweight software processes that demand ever more intermediate deliverables from developers. The purpose of this panel is to discuss under what circumstances agile methods work and don't work. Some of the key practices of agile methods are: scheduling according to feature priorities, incremental delivery of software, feedback from expert users, emphasis on face-to-face communication, pair development, minimalist design combined with refactoring, test-driven development, automated regression testing, daily integration, self-organizing teams, and",
1384.0,Excluded,ec3,How to Build an Informative Workspace? An Experience Using Data Collection and Feedback,"Several works on agile methods discuss the use of team's workspace for displaying relevant information. The management of an Informative Workspace (IW) is a challenging task as it can involve many different subjects such as team adaptability, continuous reflection, workspace layout, human cognition, usability, etc. Our paper explores the IW management and it is divided in two phases. The first phase describes a data collection performed on 8 agile teams in order to identify valuable aspects on managing an IW based on their experiences. We proposed a series of suggestions to the teams in order to improve their current context using their IW and we gathered the feedbacks. This process leds to a set of seven heuristics for managing an IW. On the second phase, in order to reinforce the heuristics validity, a five point Likert scale survey was applied resulting mostly in positive evaluations. At the end of these two phases, we associate the seven proposed heuristics, when possible, to available considerations on other agile community references.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses agile methodologies in software projects, appears to be an academic study, and involves primary research through data collection and feedback, thus meeting all the inclusion criteria."

1226.0,Excluded,ec3,Extensible Prototyping for pragmatic engineering of knowledge-based systems,"Knowledge-based systems (KBSs) have been built and practically applied in various contexts for decades. Yet, they still challenge developers by their complexity: Apart from a sound knowledge base they likewise require comprehensive user interface (UI) and interaction design for supporting the task at hand optimally. However, current KBS-Engineering methodologies still mostly focus on knowledge base development, regarding UI/interaction design a more incidental, low priority task. Thus, the \{UI\} often is developed in a rather ad hoc manner, thereby neglecting the potential of experimental design and creating reusable solutions. The integration of (rapid) evolutionary prototyping activities with \{KBS\} Engineering offers the chance for incorporating UI/interaction design more prominently into the process while at the same time leveraging the overall development task; specifically, we propose Extensible Prototyping as a tailored prototyping approach and we suggest its integration with the Agile Process Model for knowledge-based systems in this paper. For practical support, we further introduce the customized prototyping and knowledge systems engineering tool ProKEt, and we report on practical experiences with applying both the approach and the tool.","

These phases effectively maps well to any corporate or agile methodology particularly for basic requirements gathering, including business case, product or system requirements gathering, and personas and user scenarios. Rapid \{CD\} can easily supplement the deliverables required for the business analysis and requirements phases of most corporate processes. Paper prototyping is widely accepted as a means of testing design ideas and refining them. However, it should be accomplished with real user cases and not the canned test scenarios of some usability testing. The core of rapid \{CD\} is getting customer data and its implications into the design process and into the minds of designer and developers.

We detail three views: the file view shows changes at line level across many versions of a single, or a few, files. The project view shows changes at file level across entire software projects. The decomposition view shows changes at subsystem level across entire projects. We illustrate how the proposed techniques, which we implemented in a fully operational toolset, have been used to answer non-trivial questions on several real-world, industry-size software projects.

Title: Can Requirements Dependency Network Be Used as Early Indicator of Software Integration Bugs?

Abstract: Complexity cohesion and coupling have been recognized as prominent indicators for software quality. One characterization of software complexity is the existence of dependency relationship. Moreover, degree of dependency reflects the cohesion and coupling between software elements. Dependencies on design and implementation phase have been proven as important predictors for software bugs. We empirically investigated how requirements dependencies correlate with and predict software integration bugs, which can provide early estimate regarding software quality, therefore facilitate decision making early in the software lifecycle. We conducted network analysis on requirements dependency networks of two commercial software projects. We then performed correlation analysis between network measures (e.g., degree, closeness) and number of bugs. Afterwards, bug prediction models were built using these network measures. Significant correlation is observed between most of our network measures and number of bugs. These network measures can predict the number of bugs with high accuracy and sensitivity. We further identified the significant predictors for bug prediction. Besides, the indication effect of network measures on bug number varies among different types of requirements dependency. These observations show that requirements dependency network can",

Are agile methods here to stay? Some claim that agile software development methods are in the mainstream adoption phase in the software industry, while others hope that those are a passing fad. The assumption here is that if agile would not provide real improvement, adopters would be eager at first but turn pessimistic after putting it into practice. Objective Despite the growing amount of anecdotal evidence on the success of agile methods across a wide range of different real-life development settings, scientific studies remain scarce. Even less is known about the perception of the impacts of agile transformation when it is deployed in a very large software development environment, and whether agile methods are here to stay. This study aims to fill that gap by providing evidence from a large-scale agile transformation within Nokia. While we have yet to confirm these findings with solid quantitative data, we believe that the perception of the impacts already pinpoints the direction of the impacts of large-scale agile transformation. Method The data were collected using a questionnaire. The population of the study contains more than 1000 respondents in seven different countries in Europe, North America, and Asia. Results The results reveal that most respondents agree on all accounts with the generally claimed benefits of agile methods. These benefits include higher satisfaction, a feeling of effectiveness, increased quality and transparency, increased autonomy and happiness, and earlier detection of defects.

1522.0,Excluded,ec3,Interaction Design in an Engineering-Centric World,"Publisher Summary It is hard to imagine any design training that doesn't include process as a significant part of the studio experience. Put simply, process drives repeatabilityâ€”reducing the reliance on inspirationâ€”and creates a framework in which creative professionals can execute. Developers and engineers are also familiar with the use of process as a framework in which to increase the odds of repeatable results, and most have training and experience using a variety of software development processes. However, most have little experience with the â€œunderstand, design, validate, deliverâ€� sorts of processes frequently applied in design disciplines. Their own experience using a variety of engineering processes creates common ground for the two disciplines, and creates opportunities for setting expectations between the disciplines. In the design process, it is not uncommon to have to return to previous phases. Particularly in environments where clients or executives have the vision themselves to recognize that designers are not on a path to success, it is not uncommon to return to gather broader understanding about a domain, or competitors, or influences.

While relaxing, this practice fails to train students to develop the rigor to catch bugs in others' or their own code. Both trends result in an almost complete loss of intentionality in the programming activity; un-innovative code is generated by analogy with (or cut and paste from) existing solutions and is then almost randomly modified until ""it fits"" the minimal tests requirements without real analysis of its flaws.

Title: Framework for IMT-2000 networks

Abstract: IMT-2000 is a major initiative to develop a set of international standards for third generation mobile systems to support global roaming and a rich set of new services and applications across different technologies. The development of the needed standards requires a great deal of effort. The first step, and arguably the most important step, is to define as clearly as possible what an IMT-2000 system should provide. This was accomplished for the first Capability Set of IMT-2000 with the approval of ITU-T Recommendation Q.1701 (Framework for IMT-2000 Networks) in March 1999. Recommendation Q.1701 sets out the Family of Systems concept which provides the basis for the development of additional IMT-2000 standards. It provides an overall framework for the development of ITU-T IMT-2000 signalling requirements, thereby providing a guideline document for the other IMT-2000 Recommendations.

1752.0,Excluded,ec7,Non-functional requirements in business process modeling,"Business process modeling entails the capture of a set of tasks that invariably model the functional behavior of a system. Another aspect of business process modeling involves the accurate capture of operational behavior and the associated process constraints. Whether the process is automated or manual, such operational constraints and behavior exist. This may include a variety of properties including performance expectations, policy constraints, and security controls. These characteristics later manifest as the non-functional requirements of an intended system, and often such information is generally identified at some point after the business process modeling exercise. The non-functional characteristics of the business are arguably more difficult to capture in business process modeling, since the focus of such methods is the modeling of functional behavior. We propose how two new artifacts may be applied to model the constraints associated with a business process. This is the operating condition to denote a business process constraint and the control case to define controlling criteria to mitigate risk associated with an operational condition. Modeling constraints in this way provides an opportunity to capture these characteristics of business process early in the systems development life-cycle. This contributes to a model that provides a more complete representation of the overall business process. The methods will assist in mitigating risk and facilitate the early discovery of non-functional requirements during systems development.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses non-functional requirements in business process modeling, which fall under the category of software requirements using agile methodologies.

Two main processes are to be established: creating a reusable infrastructure, and utilizing it for developing products.

Thus, various approaches, such as proactive, reactive, or agile, have been introduced to handle changes. At a finer level of granularity, however, changes comprise many activities with variable duration and thus result in sets of concurrent and overlapping software development activities. This paper, therefore, investigates changes in more detail and assumes that provisioning comprehensive information on changes and respective states are crucial to organizations for keeping a software product line manageable.

How can one capitalize on the strengths of agile development models while still appealing to established software engineering practices? The typical introductory software engineering course makes use of a team-based project to reinforce software process activities. The project normally runs for one academic term during which students are led through life-cycle activities using a modified waterfall approach to software development. While useful in teaching software engineering process concepts, this approach limits the team's ability to utilize feedback from downstream process activities. It also limits the students' opportunity to understand process improvement from their own experiences. The ability to respond to project change is also dampened by the fact that teams do not have the time or resources in this format to modify, or refactor the design of a project component let alone incorporate a new or modified customer requirement. Agile methodologies promote an evolutionary approach to development using short incremental release cycles. We report on the experiences of conducting a team project in an introductory software engineering course using agile development techniques at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Teams have the opportunity to experience multiple iterations of the software engineering life cycle and evolve a product design that allows for discoveries made during implementation and through the introduction of changing customer requirements.

343.0,Included,included,Adoption of XP practices in the industry - A survey,"Agile software development has recently become popular in the software industry. The methodologies in the Agile family are considered to be based on best practices. The most popular approach, Extreme Programming (XP), recommends certain best practices during the requirements gathering, implementation and testing phases of software development. In this paper, the authors analyze the best practices according to data from recent case studies and survey studies to see if and how they are followed. Metaphor was the least used practice, while unit testing was one of the most popular. Most of the practices varied across studies and projects. Agile software development is evolutionary in nature, so customizing the practices is still well within its sounds. Copyright Â© 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","

In this paper, we analyze the effectiveness of agile development workshops through an experiment, and show that one of representative workshops is indeed effective at learning agile principles. Self-study is another commonly used method to learn something new. Therefore, we compare the effectiveness of workshops with that of self-study to better illustrate the effectiveness of agile development workshops. In our experiment, we examine 7 workshop subjects and 8 self-study subjects, and compare their scores on the agile mind check, which is a method used to measure their degree of mastery of agile principles. As a result, we demonstrate the effectiveness of agile development workshops, especially those that simulate actual experiences. We also show that one of workshops is more effective than self-study regarding the agile mind check score.","

83.0,Included,included,A comparative case study on clients participation in a 'traditional' and in an Agile software company,"Agile literature suggests that the active and continuous participation and involvement of the clients throughout the project is key to building the right product and raise users' satisfaction. However, relatively little research has been made on comparing what makes clients happy in 'traditional' companies that use planed-driven processes and in agile companies. In turn, it's hard to collect and evaluate evidence in favor of either settings. This paper fills in this gap and compares two software development companies in a Nord-European country in respect to client participation and its impact on the clients' satisfaction with the project. One of the companies is agile by its design while the other follows a 'traditional' software development approach. Our study suggests that active clients' participation is not an exclusive attribute of agile projects and that it can be successfully integrated (and implemented) in a 'traditional' project as well. Further, the study shows that by involving clients, software companies have the chance to get higher customer satisfaction, regardless whether or not they implement agile software development processes.

1866.0,Excluded,ec7,Practical Challenges for Methods Transforming i* Goal Models into Business Process Models," The field of requirements engineering for business processes has grown during the last several years. As business processes are assumed to fulfil organizational goals, goal models could be transformed into business process models that specify how business processes fulfil the organizational goals. Although both the fields of Goal-Oriented RE (GORE) and Business Process Management (BPM) received a lot of attention from researchers, the methods to transform goal models into business process models still need further research. This scientific evaluation paper analyses current methods to identify the practical challenges that need to be addressed for an effective transformation of goal models into business process models. We illustrate the discovered challenges using the case study of Seven-Eleven Japan. The main challenges that were discovered are a lack of responsible role, insufficient concept mappings, informality of the transformation algorithm, no full support for organisational structure and a lack of inter-model consistency checks. Our expected contribution of discovering these challenges is to lower the barriers of transferring new goal-to-process methods to industry. As we consider i* constructs the most adequate in GORE for our purposes, we limit our study to transformations that start from i* goal models.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses requirements in software projects using agile methodologies (IC1), is a study from academia (IC2), and is a primary study (IC4).

The team could have postponed the \{UI\} evaluations but instead chose to try to take full advantage of the test participants already scheduled and to conduct a hybrid method wherein they, in parallel, gathered user requirements information and evaluated the \{UI\} prototype. They selected the pluralistic usability \{WT\} as their evaluation method, both because it allowed them to collect data from a number of these valuable and hard-to-schedule users at the same time and that it would allow for a dialogue between these representative users and the product developers, thus speeding up the back-and-forth that was necessary if they were to be engaged in an iterative design process. The team added a requirements-gathering exercise onto the front of the pluralistic usability \{WT\} to collect user requirements data before biasing the pluralistic usability \{WT\} participants with the \{UI\} prototype.

Unpredictable workloads, however, aggravate the semantic gap between the virtual machine monitor and guest operating systems, leading to inefficient resource management. In particular, \{CPU\} management for virtual machines has a critical impact on I/O performance in cases where the virtual machine monitor is agnostic about the internal workloads of each virtual machine. This paper presents virtual machine scheduling techniques for transparently bridging the semantic gap that is a result of consolidated workloads. To enable us to achieve this goal, we ensure that the virtual machine monitor is aware of task-level I/O-boundedness inside a virtual machine using inference techniques, thereby improving I/O performance without compromising \{CPU\} fairness. In addition, we address performance anomalies arising from the indirect use of I/O devices via a driver virtual machine at the scheduling level. The proposed techniques are implemented on the Xen virtual machine monitor and evaluated with micro-benchmarks and real workloads on Linux and Windows guest operating systems.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses requirements in software projects using agile methodologies (IC1), and it is a study from academia (IC2).

Proponents of agile processes/methods (such as extreme programming) suggest that these ""lightweight"" approaches are extremely effective. I would agree that there are many powerful aspects within these approaches. I suggest, however, that by taking an objective-based business requirements approach to project management, software projects have a high probability of running on time, and remaining in scope and within budget. Addressing requirement challenges, independent of adopting a full process, can offer many of the benefits of full process adoption while avoiding most of the expense and human issues involved with full process rollout. A business-based requirements approach is an easy-to-adopt, risk-free entry point that offers tangible quality improvements. This approach suits any project scope.

Lean software development propagates two important principles that help process improvement, namely identification of waste in the process and considering interactions between the individual parts of the software process from an end-to-end perspective. A large shift of thinking about the own way of working is often required to adopt lean. One of the potential main sources of failure is to try to make a too large shift about the ways of working at once. Therefore, the change to lean has to be done in a continuous and incremental way. In response to this we propose a novel approach to bring together the quality improvement paradigm and lean software development practices, the approach being called Software Process Improvement through the Lean Measurement (SPI-LEAM) Method.
