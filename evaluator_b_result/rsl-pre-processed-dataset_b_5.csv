However, most enabling technologies related to dynamic spectrum access are considered individually. In this paper, we consider these key technologies jointly and introduce a new implementation scheme for a Dynamic Spectrum Access Network Based on Cognitive Radio (DSAN-BCR). We start with a flexible hardware platform for DSAN-BCR, as well as a flexible protocol structure that dominates the operation of DSAN-BCR. We then focus on the state of the art of key technologies such as spectrum sensing, spectrum resources management, dynamic spectrum access, and routing that are below the network layer in DSAN-BCR, as well as the development of technologies related to higher layers. Last but not the least, we analyze the challenges confronted by these mentioned technologies in DSAN-BCR, and give the perspectives on the future development of these technologies.

Quality standards like ISO/IEC-12207 provide a guideline for structuring of development work and improving process and product quality. A considerable number of tools has emerged supporting and automating parts of development work. On \{W7X\} progress has been made during the last years in exploiting the benefit of automation and management during software development:â€“ Continuous build, integration and automated test of software artefacts.âˆ˜ Syntax checks and code quality metrics. âˆ˜ Documentation generation. âˆ˜ Feedback for developers by temporal statistics. â€“ Versioned repository for build products (libraries, executables). â€“ Separate snapshot and release repositories and automatic deployment. â€“ Semi-automatic provisioning of applications. â€“ Feedback from testers and feature requests by ticket system. This toolset is working efficiently and allows the team to concentrate on development. The activity there is presently focused on increasing the quality of the existing software to become a dependable product. Testing of single functions and qualities must be simplified. So a restructuring is underway which relies more on small, individually testable components with standardized interfaces providing the capability to construct arbitrary function aggregates for dedicated tests of quality attributes as availability, reliability, performance. A further activity is on improving the development cycle. The use of release cycles has already provided favourable concentration of work and predictability of delivery times. However, the demand has risen, to react quickly on priority changes from W7X-project management. So a more agile development cycle is being prepared relying on smaller working packages, shorter release cycles and an associated release plan giving the software development responsible the possibility to react on a shorter time scale.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses requirements in software projects using agile methodologies (IC1), is a study from academia as it discusses progress and restructuring in software development (IC2), is qualitative research with a description of activities and progress (IC3), and is a primary study since it discusses direct experiences and observations (IC4).

This research aims to increase the individuals' motivation to write documentation by means of reputation. The CollabReview prototype is a web-based reputation system that analyzes artifacts of internal documentation to derive personal reputation scores. Developers making many good contributions will achieve higher reputation scores. These scores can then be employed to softly influence developer behavior, e.g. by incentivizing them to contribute to documentation with social rewards.

However, the reality may not be as simple or linear as the term implies. To provide a better understanding of the combined use of agile and lean approaches in software development, a set of experience reports were analysed.

652.0,Included,included,Balancing agile and structured development approaches to successfully manage large distributed software projects: A case study from the cruise line industry,"Agile methods and traditional structured approaches are often viewed as competing bi-polar choices. Agile methods such as Scrum and XP are recommended for small, co-located projects that involve changing requirements. The traditional structured plan-driven approaches, such as the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and the waterfall lifecycle frameworks, are recommended for large projects with stable requirements. If a project is large, strategically important, distributed, and has dynamic user requirements and organizational changes, it presents unique challenges that neither the agile methods nor the traditional structured approaches can effectively deal with alone. Although there is an increasing call for a balanced approach, there is little empirical research that shows when and how the two approaches can complement each other. Based on a case study from the cruise line industry of a large distributed strategic project with unanticipated changes, we conclude that this balance is not only workable, but is essential to ensure that the project demonstrates both control and agility for achieving its challenging and dynamic goals. Agile without structure can cause chaos, particularly in large complex distributed projects where planning, control, and coordination are critical. Structure without agility can lead to rigidity, particularly when a project involves a great deal of learning, discovery, and changes.

However, the extent to which a customized method supports the organizational objectives, i.e. the `goodness' of that method, is questionable. Existing agile assessment approaches focus on comparative analyses, or are limited in scope and application. In this research, we propose a structured, systematic, and comprehensive approach to assessing the `goodness' of agile methods. We examine an agile method based on (1) its adequacy, (2) the capability of the organization to support the adopted principles and practices specified by the method, and (3) the method's effectiveness. We propose the Objectives, Principles and Practices (OPP) Framework to guide our assessment. The Framework identifies (1) objectives of the agile philosophy, (2) principles that support the objectives, (3) practices that are reflective of the principles, (4) linkages among the objectives, principles and practices, and (5) indicators for assessing the extent to which an organization supports the implementation and the effectiveness of that practice.

In this paper it is argued that if the goal of research in computational vision is considered to be that of understanding and designing seeing systems, then we need a design strategy.

The first innovation was promiscuous pair story authoring, where user stories were written by two people (similarly to pair programming), and the pairing changed very often (as frequently as every 15-20 minutes) to achieve promiscuity and cater for diverse point of views. The second innovation was an economic value evaluation (and not the cost) which was attributed to stories. Continuous recalculation of the financial value of the stories allowed to assess the projects financial return. In this case implementation of agility in the international context allowed the involved team members to reach consensus and unanimity of decisions, vision and purpose.

Several reports from large companies such as Bosch, Nokia, Philips and Siemens witness gains and benefits achieved with their use, especially with respect to the reduction on time to market. In SPL development, domain analysis plays a central role where the relevant features are identified. Feature-Oriented Domain Analysis is a method which uses a feature model to specify variabilities and commonalities of an SPL. However, activities related to the Domain Analysis process (managing commonalities and variabilities, with users visibility and relevant stakeholders) in most cases, do not seem to be a simple and easy activity, since to represent these analyzes in modelling domain tools with a certain degree of formality, requires a technical knowledge that domain experts do not always have it prior to use. But creative requirements techniques have been suggested to facilitate the elicitation activity by filling the gap the communications problems between domain experts and software engineers, making the domain analysis more agile. Thus, to improve the domain analysis process, this paper seeks to set out the use of a creative and agile technique for modelling requirements by means of mind maps for cognitive and effective support when building feature models.",INCLUDED,"The article meets all inclusion criteria as it addresses requirements in software projects using agile methodologies (IC1).

In some cases, requirements analysts or involved stakeholders do not fully understand the requirements that other disciplines impose, and thus fail to deliver a requirements specification that can be used in interdisciplinary development teams. In requirements engineering, requirement patterns are used to recognize important and recurring issues, thus reducing the effort of compiling a list of software requirements. The objective of the proposed dissertation project is to develop a similar pattern based approach that helps in analysing requirements from different disciplines and making them comprehensible for all stakeholders who need to agree to a requirement specification as the deliverable of requirements engineering. Due to the importance of legal aspects for, and users' trust in, socio-technical systems, requirement patterns will be developed for these two aspects. For the legal requirement patterns, legal requirements that are stable concerning changes due to their origin in fundamental, higher-ranked laws will be collected, and requirement patterns will be derived from them. For the requirement patterns for trust support, antecedents that build trust will be collected, and requirement patterns that demand functionality to support these antecedents will be developed. The obtained patterns are then used to compile a requirement list that serves as input for requirements negotiation with the various stakeholders.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses requirements in software projects using agile methodologies (IC1), is from academia (not specified but can be inferred as a dissertation project which typically falls under academic research), and is qualitative research (through the development of requirement patterns and compiling a requirement list, which involves analysis and synthesis rather than numerical data).

375.0,Included,included,Agile development: issues and avenues requiring a substantial enhancement of the business perspective in large projects,"Large-scale projects, are often delivering low value software to businesses due to stakeholders' misunderstanding. Evolutionary software development represents an alternative to plan-driven development in order to tackle today's turbulent environments. In agile development, a type of evolutionary development, the product owner (P.O.) who is the customer representative---real accountable role---is ill-equipped to identify and prioritize the stakeholders' most success-critical expectations and potential sources of business value. Furthermore, the tools he can use have their own scalability issues that question their underlying principles. Moreover, without a substantial involvement to take into account all stakeholders, software providers are more likely acting as commodity-utility providers than real business partners. In today's business context, there is a clear need for a value-driven development which embraces changes along with higher visibility and understanding of business transformations.
The current problems of software crisis could be condensed in a twofold business perspective dilemma: Doing the right product and providing efficient guidance to the development project. Approaches based on goals have been successfully used in Requirements Engineering (RE) and IT governance to address issues similar to the current software crisis.

These methodologies, such as Scrum, eXtreme Programming (XP), and Feature-Driven Development (FDD) date back to 1990s, and the Agile Manifesto was declared in 2001. However, already before that the concept of agile manufacturing (AM) was discovered to describe a corporate ability for quick adaptation to changing requirements. There is surprising amount in common between these two fields. This raises a question of whether NPD software development companies could take even more overall advantage of those different agile approaches. This interdisciplinary paper explores the commonalities between the key concepts of AM and some of the most popular agile software methods, and consequently suggests potential new areas for software process improvement (SPI) in large-scale NPD organizations. An industrial case example illustrates how agility in embedded software product development can be enhanced by following typical NPD principles. We conclude that there is potential for further improvements in software product development industry in general by seeing agility as a wider, organization-oriented business concept following the AM/NPD learning.

904.0,Included,included,Communication patterns of agile requirements engineering,"An agile software development team relies on communication and collaboration to perform requirements engineering activities, rather than on dedicated analysis tools or documentation. Evidence from practice indicates that two simple physical artefacts (story cards and the wall), used in a particular and disciplined manner, and supported by appropriate social activity, are key to the success of co-located agile teams. However, little is known about this social activity or how communication and collaboration supports requirements activities in this setting. This paper reports an empirical study of a commercial agile team to investigate this issue. Using a combination of qualitative data collection and cognitive analysis techniques, we found evidence of gathering, evolving and clarifying requirements that are managed through patterns of communication. These patterns suggest that a form of situated conceptualization, which we have termed 'shared conceptualization', underpins the team's requirements engineering activities.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses requirements in software projects using agile methodologies (IC1), and is a study from commercial practice (IC2).

The question remains, however, if they are equally applicable to the systems and enterprise engineering found in large or complex system environments. This paper builds on previous conceptual work to describe specific applications of the concepts to support coordination of systems engineering activities within large-scale system acquisition, development and evolution.

148.0,Included,included,A lightweight framework for describing software practices,"In order to maximise software project outcomes, software organisations adapt development methodologies and implement practices in a way that is appropriate for project contexts. This suggests that â€˜Best Practiceâ€™ is context-dependent. To better understand the contextual nature of best practice, we want to explore how organisations actually go about achieving software objectives. We require a research framework that captures this information in a way that makes no assumptions about practices and that is descriptive in nature. We have developed a framework based on the perspective that practices exist to meet specific objectives. We have experimented with the framework by using it to capture the practices of three New Zealand organisations and by application to an idealised \{XP\} process. Our capture of organisational practices revealed interesting mechanisms for further study, including a dependence upon informal practices linked with strong communication and the idea of â€˜pushâ€™ versus â€˜pullâ€™ for information elicitation. Our capture of \{XP\} exposed some context-dependent risks.",INCLUDED,"The article meets the Inclusion Criteria (IC1, IC2, IC3, IC4) by addressing software practices in project contexts using agile methodologies, being from academic research, qualitative in nature, and primary in study.

We were interested in studying collaboration in agile teams including interaction designers, since the integration of user interaction design processes and software development processes is still an open issue. This study focused on designer and developer collaborations in the early stages of project work at four workplaces. We found designer-developer collaborations were extensive and we developed a categorization scheme of collaboration forms and artefacts that support this relationship. While some designer-developer collaborations were directed towards planning, which has been extensively researched, a larger part was directed towards realignment work. This latter type of collaborative work took three basic forms: scheduled, impromptu, and chats. Regardless of the form of collaboration, designer-developer interactions were mediated by twelve categories of artefacts. These artefacts helped designers and developers to determine, more specifically, what to create.

Maybe we should try ""lean and mean"" software process models, rather than making them ""richer."" At minimum, we should try to analyze why the rich approaches have not worked; where they failed. Could it be that we were trying to solve the wrong problem? or that the real problems by far overshadow the process model issue? Or maybe the whole construction paradigm we use for software development is not suitable anymore? My position is that we should try the route of very simple software process models, to ensure a wider applicability, greater versatility, and acceptance. Possibly these new process models would be based on other paradigms of software or system development than the ""technical-rational"" construction idea. I would be wary of richer process models.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses the topic of software process models using agile methodologies (IC1), it is a scholarly article, thus satisfying the academic criterion (IC2), and seems to be a qualitative analysis of why rich process models have not been successful (IC3).

In the study, we captured the practices the teams felt contributed to rapid delivery. We identified a mix of Agile and architecture practices that teams apply to rapidly field software and minimize disruption and delay. In this paper, we elaborate one practice from the study, prototyping with quality attribute focus. We compared two experiences in prototyping focused on quality attribute considerations applied on Scrum projects. We observe through interviews that feature development and prototyping practice spans multiple levels: feature development/sprint, release planning, and portfolio planning. We also observe other factors including rapid trade-off analysis, flexible architecture, and adoption of a set of enabling prototyping guidelines. The analysis of the observations sheds light on several aspects of the practice that enable the team to respond quickly and efficiently when prototype feedback suggests architectural change.

Abstract: Current practice in software engineering suggests a radical change in perspective: where once stood fixed teams of people following a development plan, now stand just-in-time Dynamic Networked Organizations (DyNOs), adopting a common flexible strategy for development, rather than a plan. This shift in perspective has gone relatively unnoticed by current software engineering research. This paper offers a glimpse at what processes and instruments lie beyond “current” software engineering research, where studying emergent DyNOs, their creation and steering becomes critical. To understand the underpinnings of this evolution, we explored a simple yet vivid scenario from real-life industrial practice. Using scenario analysis we elicited a number of social and organizational requirements in working with DyNOs. Also, comparing our evidence with literature, we made some key observations. First, managing DyNOs makes organizational requirements a first-class entity for development success. Second, research in software engineering should be invested in understanding and governing the DyNOs behind the software lifecycle.
