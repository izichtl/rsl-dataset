1.0,Excluded,ec7, [vem:xi:] - A Methodology for Process Based Requirements Engineering," Service-oriented architectures (SOA) aim at the alignment of business and IT by having a clear business process-centric focus. In order to reach that goal, real-world business processes are captured by business process models. These models serve as the basis for the declarative configuration of a SOA using appropriate deployment artifacts - i.e., XML-based process languages. Consequently, requirements engineering for SOAs must focus on business processes and on their integration into systems using interoperable services, which is not the case for most conventional requirements engineering approaches. In this paper we present a requirements engineering approach specifically designed for the engineering of SOAs. Requirements are captured using a unified process, based on phases and iterations eventually leading to a formalized and unambiguous requirements specification. The final requirements specification can be used in succeeding development phases - i.e. for the modeldriven generation of deployment artifactsfor SOAs. The presented solution is called [vem:xi:] and is successfully used in the IT department of a Mobile Network Operator (MNO) in Austria. In the highly volatile world of mobile communication the presented approach enables faster application development and faster integration of solutions, thus leading to a competitive advantage over other market participants."
2.0,Excluded,ec7, Reconciling Multi-jurisdictional Legal Requirements: A Case Study in Requirements Water Marking,"Companies that own, license, or maintain personal information face a daunting number of privacy and security regulations. Companies are subject to new regulations from one or more governing bodies, when companies introduce new or existing products into a jurisdiction, when regulations change, or when data is transferred across political borders. To address this problem, we developed a framework called “requirements water marking” that business analysts can use to align and reconcile requirements from multiple jurisdictions (municipalities, provinces, nations) to produce a single high or low standard of care. We evaluate the framework in an empirical case study conducted over a subset of U.S. data breach notification laws that require companies to secure their data and notify consumers in the event of data loss or theft. In this study, applying our framework reduced the number of requirements a company must comply with by 76% across 8 jurisdictions. We show how the framework surfaces critical requirements trade-offs and potential regulatory conflicts that companies must address during the reconciliation process. We summarize our results, including surveys of information technology law experts to contextualize our empirical results in legal practice."
3.0,Excluded,ec7, User Feedback in the AppStore: An Empirical Study ,"Application distribution platforms - or app stores - such as Google Play or Apple AppStore allow users to submit feedback in form of ratings and reviews to downloaded applications. In the last few years, these platforms have become very popular to both application developers and users. However, their real potential for and impact on requirements engineering processes are not yet well understood. This paper reports on an exploratory study, which analyzes over one million reviews from the Apple AppStore.We investigated how and when users provide feedback, inspected the feedback content, and analyzed its impact on the user community. We found that most of the feedback is provided shortly after new releases, with a quickly decreasing frequency over time. Reviews typically contain multiple topics, such as user experience, bug reports, and feature requests. The quality and constructiveness vary widely, from helpful advices and innovative ideas to insulting offenses. Feedback content has an impact on download numbers: positive messages usually lead to better ratings and vice versa. Negative feedback such as shortcomings is typically destructive and misses context details and user experience. We discuss our findings and their impact on software and requirements engineering teams."
5.0,Included,included,"""Scrum Code Camps""","A classic way to choose a supplier is through a bidding process where tenders from competing companies are evaluated in relation to the customer's requirements. If the customer wants to hire an agile software developing team instead of buying a software product, a new approach for comparing tenders is required. In this paper we present the design of such a new approach, the Scrum Code Camp, which can be used to assess agile team capability in a transparent and consistent way. A design science research approach is used to analyze properties of two instances of the Scrum Code Camp where seven agile teams were evaluated."
7.0,Included,included,\{CASE\} 9 - The \{HURIE\} method: A case study combining requirements gathering and user interface evaluation,"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses that as the usability team evaluates the emerging user interface (UI) design for a game like tool for teaching battle command software through distance learning, they found themselves in the uneasy position of having started to plan for two pluralistic usability walk-throughs (WTs) with two different but equally time-constrained user samples and a new discovery that even the product development team members were uncertain as to the product requirements. The team could have postponed the \{UI\} evaluations but instead chose to try to take full advantage of the test participants already scheduled and to conduct a hybrid method wherein they, in parallel, gathered user requirements information and evaluated the \{UI\} prototype. They selected the pluralistic usability \{WT\} as their evaluation method, both because it allowed them to collect data from a number of these valuable and hard-to-schedule users at the same time and that it would allow for a dialogue between these representative users and the product developers, thus speeding up the back-and-forth that was necessary if they were to be engaged in an iterative design process. The team added a requirements-gathering exercise onto the front of the pluralistic usability \{WT\} to collect user requirements data before biasing the pluralistic usability \{WT\} participants with the \{UI\} prototype. The early delivery of a \{UI\} prototype for evaluation helps meet the agile principle of early and continuous delivery."
9.0,Excluded,ec4,\{CHAPTER\} 3 - Hacking as a Career,"Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on hacking as a career and discusses how one can develop a career as a penetration tester. Penetration testing expertise can be narrowed down into three different fields: networks, systems, and applications. Penetration testers with a network architecture background can identify deficiencies in a large variety of network designs, penetration testers who specialize in system administration often expand the knowledge of an operating system by learning about things such as secure communication protocols, file sharing, directory services, system hardening, backup processes, and more. Penetration testers who specialize in application and databases typically understand what it takes to create applications and how they interact with databases. The chapter offers information on some of the certifications of information systems security (ISS), such as the (ISC)2, the (ISC)2 CBK, Systems Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP), Certification and Accreditation Professional (CAP), Certified Secure Software Lifecycle Professional (CSSLP), and CISSPâ€“ISSEP. Certifications are helpful in employment and government related exams and contracts. There are a variety of information security organizations that disseminate news about the happenings within the industry, including local and national associations. Many security conferences provide training opportunities, while some mailing lists provide the latest in news and vulnerabilities related to information security."
12.0,Excluded,ec3,\{IT\} support for clinical pathwaysâ€”Lessons learned,"Clinical pathways are an effective instrument to decrease undesired practice variability and improve clinician performance. IT-applications embedded into clinical routine work can help to increase pathway compliance. Successfully implementing such applications requires both a responsive \{IT\} infrastructure and a participatory and iterative design process aimed at achieving user acceptance and usability. Experiences from the implementation and iterative improvement of an online surgical pathway at Marburg University Medical Centre have shown that pathway conformance actually could be improved by the use of IT. An analysis of the iterative design process has shown that future pathway projects can benefit from the lessons learned during this project. Based on these lessons recommendations for developing well adapted interaction mechanisms are presented, aimed at improving process alignment. Our goal is to build up a library of tested reusable components to reduce the number of iterations for pathway implementation."
14.0,Excluded,ec7,\{MC\} Sandbox: Devising a tool for method-user-centered method configuration,"Context Method engineering approaches are often based on the assumption that method users are able to explicitly express their situational method requirements. Similar to systems requirements, method requirements are often vague and hard to explicate. In this paper we address the issue of involving method users early in method configuration. This is done through borrowing ideas from user-centered design and prototyping, and implementing them on the method engineering layer. Objective We design a computerized tool, \{MC\} Sandbox, to capture method requirements through the use of method-user-centered method configuration, hence bridging the gap between systems developersâ€™ and method engineersâ€™ understanding of and expectations on a situational method. Method The research method adopted can be characterized as multi-grounded action research. Our implementation of multi-grounded action research follows the traditional â€˜canonicalâ€™ action research method, which has cycles of diagnosing, action planning, action taking, evaluating, and specifying learning. The research project comprised three such action research cycles where 10 action cases were performed. Results \{MC\} Sandbox has proven useful in eliciting and negotiating method requirements in a continuously ongoing dialog between the method users and the method engineers during configuration workshops. The results also show that the method engineer role rotated among the systems developers and that they were indeed committed to the negotiated methods during the systems development projects. Conclusion It is possible for method users to actively participate and construct suitable situational methods if they are provided with appropriate high-level modelling concepts, such as method components, configuration packages and configuration templates. This way, the project membersâ€™ understanding of the current development practice develops incrementally, both in terms of understanding the needs and available method support. In addition, both method requirements and commitments are made explicit, which are important aspects when working with method configuration from a collaboration point of view."
15.0,Excluded,ec7,\{MDD\} vs. traditional software development: A practitionerâ€™s subjective perspective,"Context Todayâ€™s project managers have a myriad of methods to choose from for the development of software applications. However, they lack empirical data about the character of these methods in terms of usefulness, ease of use or compatibility, all of these being relevant variables to assess the developerâ€™s intention to use them. Objective To compare three methods, each following a different paradigm (Model-Driven, Model-Based and Code-Centric) with respect to their adoption potential by junior software developers engaged in the development of the business layer of a Web 2.0 application. Method We have conducted a quasi-experiment with 26 graduate students of the University of Alicante. The application developed was a Social Network, which was organized around a fixed set of modules. Three of them, similar in complexity, were used for the experiment. Subjects were asked to use a different method for each module, and then to answer a questionnaire that gathered their perceptions during such use. Results The results show that the Model-Driven method is regarded as the most useful, although it is also considered the least compatible with previous developersâ€™ experiences. They also show that junior software developers feel comfortable with the use of models, and that they are likely to use them if the models are accompanied by a Model-Driven development environment. Conclusions Despite their relatively low level of compatibility, Model-Driven development methods seem to show a great potential for adoption. That said, however, further experimentation is needed to make it possible to generalize the results to a different population, different methods, other languages and tools, different domains or different application sizes."
16.0,Excluded,ec7,\{MDE\} software process lines in small companies,"Software organizations specify their software processes so that process knowledge can be systematically reused across projects. However, different projects may require different processes. Defining a separate process for each potential project context is expensive and error-prone, since these processes must simultaneously evolve in a consistent manner. Moreover, an organization cannot envision all possible project contexts in advance because several variables may be involved, and these may also be combined in different ways. This problem is even worse in small companies since they usually cannot afford to define more than one process. Software process lines are a specific type of software product lines, in the software process domain. A benefit of software process lines is that they allow software process customization with respect to a context. In this article we propose a model-driven approach for software process lines specification and configuration. The article also presents two industrial case studies carried out at two small Chilean software development companies. Both companies have benefited from applying our approach to their processes: new projects are now developed using custom processes, process knowledge is systematically reused, and the total time required to customize a process is much shorter than before."
17.0,Excluded,ec7,\{MNE\} software for processing \{MEG\} and \{EEG\} data,"Abstract Magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (M/EEG) measure the weak electromagnetic signals originating from neural currents in the brain. Using these signals to characterize and locate brain activity is a challenging task, as evidenced by several decades of methodological contributions. MNE, whose name stems from its capability to compute cortically-constrained minimum-norm current estimates from M/EEG data, is a software package that provides comprehensive analysis tools and workflows including preprocessing, source estimation, timeâ€“frequency analysis, statistical analysis, and several methods to estimate functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. The present paper gives detailed information about the \{MNE\} package and describes typical use cases while also warning about potential caveats in analysis. The \{MNE\} package is a collaborative effort of multiple institutes striving to implement and share best methods and to facilitate distribution of analysis pipelines to advance reproducibility of research. Full documentation is available at http://martinos.org/mne."
20.0,Excluded,ec7,\{UML\} 2.0 and agents: how to build agent-based systems with the new \{UML\} standard,"Unified Modeling Language (UML 2.0) is the upcoming standard of the Object Management Group for specifying object-oriented software systems. In this paper, we will show how \{UML\} 2.0 can be applied for the specification of agent-based systems. Moreover, we will give a short overview on existing agent methodologies to have a reference what has to be specified in such systems. The paper concludes with some outlook for further research and open issues for specifying agents with \{UML\} 2.0."

30.0,Excluded,ec4,19 - \{STAGE\} 3: Overview,"Publisher Summary This chapter presents an overview of the Stage 3 of the development of trading and investment systems. This stage accomplishes the transformation task, turning the specifications of the trading/investment system into software and hardware, where the design of the trading system from previous stages becomes the specification requirements for the software design. At this stage, the task of building software and hardware components of the trading/investment system include a development team in addition to the product team. The lead programmer/IT member of the product team manages this somewhat agile development team, which will engage in test-driven development. The financial engineers from the product team over the course of Stage 3 manage software quality assurance of business tier software. The traders from the product team perform and/or oversee quality assurance over GUI, integration, and reporting mechanisms, as well as run user-acceptance tests. The marketing person from the product team writes or oversees the writing of the user documentation for the software. Addition of a risk manager, who will learn the specifics of the trading/investment system and be able to recommend how best to build out the risk management functions and reporting requirements, is also recommended. A development team develops software iteratively, and this iterative development dramatically increases feedback versus sequential development, providing closer communication between the product team and the development team."

33.0,Excluded,ec7,2 - Object-Oriented Analysis and Design,"Publisher Summary This chapter gives an account of the fundamental features of an object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD). The chapter introduces the unified modeling language (UML) as a notation for capturing and presenting the results of an OOAD. To obtain the full leverage of the \{UML\} one must superimpose on it a lifecycle development process. A guiding principle is that an \{OOAD\} process should be use-case driven, architecture centric, iterative, and incremental. A use-case diagram describes a single task that a system needs to perform. The totality of the individual use-cases should describe the full system requirements. An object diagram presents the architectural relationship between objects. It is the same as a collaboration diagram without any messages. An activity diagram is used to show the flow of control among the activities. Activity diagrams can be presented at various levels: as an analysis diagram or as method logic. A class diagram records the classes identified in the problem domain together with the architectural relationships that exist between them. A class symbol is decorated with the class name, the class attributes, and the class operations. Relationships between classes include association and composite aggregation."
34.0,Excluded,ec7,2 - The Harmony Process,"Publisher Summary This chapter briefly describes the Harmony process, both in the general form that contains a systems engineering phase and software-only form. The Harmony process consists of a set of integrated workflows for each phase in the process. In the general form the development spiral is preceded by a systems-engineering phase that elaborates all the requirements of the system and constructs a well-formed and executable use-case model. Then an internal subsystem architecture is created, and the requirements, represented primarily as â€œoperational contracts,â€� are allocated to these subsystems. The subsystems themselves are broken into high-level engineering discipline-specific components for electronic, mechanical, chemical, and software aspects and the logical interfaces among these components are defined. At this point, the models are handed off to the subsystem teams and their engineering disciplines for further development. The software-only enables some optimizations by the lack of hardware-software development. In Harmony-SW, use cases are identified but not detailed until they are about to be developed. With the development spiral a small set of use cases are selected and detailed with sequence diagrams, state machines or activity diagrams. This is followed by the creation of an object analysis model to capture the requirements of the use case. A methodology consists of a language to specify elements and relations of interest and a process that tells the developer what parts of the language to use, how to use them, and when to use them. The Harmony process 1 uses \{UML\} and variants, such as the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) or the Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) \{UML\} profiles, as the language. The Harmony process also specifies an integrated set of workflows to guide the developer so that they can use the \{UML\} to its fullest advantage in developing robust, capable, and safe systems.1 The Harmony process is basically the next revision in the \{ROPES\} (rapid Object-oriented Process for Embedded Systems) process, discussed in the author's previous books with greatly expanded coverage for systems engineering."
36.0,Excluded,ec7,2.4 - Item Qualification Test Implementation,"Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on item qualification test implementation and concepts related to qualification test sequencing. The verification implementation coordination work begins with the assurance that all needed verification tasks are identified in approved planning for all product items or for those that lead the schedule. All tasks should be listed in the verification task matrix in terms of the name of the tasks, the product item to which they apply, the method to be applied, the responsibility for planning and implementing the work, and the date on which the tasks must begin and end. These entries act as the direction for work that must be accomplished, and it should be recognized that at any particular point of time the work may or may not have been accomplished. Hence, the system-coordinating agent must ensure that the person or team identified as the responsible agent accepts it and agrees to work toward the indicated schedule and goals. The chapter discusses general coordination activities and individual test coordination in detail. An overview of the inter-test and inter-method coordination is also presented in the chapter."
37.0,Included,included,20 - Plan and Document Technology Specifications,"Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on the process of planning and documenting technology specifications during the Stage 3 of the investment/trading system. The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is the foundation on which the architecture, design, and implementation of a trading/investment system are built. While prototypes have been created for most features, the team will encounter and address them one by one in an iterative fashion. An \{SRS\} for a trading/investment system consists of the combined, ordered, and linked descriptions and documents, and prototypes created in earlier stages, including data dictionary, data maps and data flow maps, \{GUI\} requirements, error handling maps, and report generation maps. An iteration plan lays out the designâ€“buildâ€“test scenario for each piece of the system, tackling the features with the highest business priority and risk first. The team leader uses timeboxed iteration cycles to track progress of completed tasks and features as development progresses and at each iteration planning meeting, the development team breaks down features into tasks and assigns tasks to team members. When team members complete tasks, they erase them or cross them out. During iteration meetings, the team should also make estimates for computer capacity, server and database use, and network capacity, which should all be documented as they impact departments and personnel external to the development team. The team should also be cognizant of risks to external dependencies, such as delays caused by other departments or vendors. The quickest way to shorten a software development schedule is to buy components or reuse existing software. If the team intends to base a trading/investment system on a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) application, they should incorporate aspects of that software into the design of glue code or middleware that is developed in-house."

43.0,Included,included,259 Managing Requirements Uncertainty in Engine Control Systems Development,"In the development of complex systems the requirements for the system will almost always remain uncertain late into the software development. In gas turbine engine control systems at Rolls-Royce, typically 50% of requirements will change between Critical Design Review and Entry into Service. Ignoring or not planning for requirements uncertainty will cause scrap and rework that will manifest later in the project. This paper evaluates the impact of not managing these uncertainties and describes how Rolls-Royce uses Requirements Uncertainty Analysis to reduce this impact. The paper summarises the findings from an extensive Six Sigma study into requirements uncertainty and provides an overview of the technique now used to identify and monitor uncertainty through a project life. The return on investment of this technique has been between 100:1 and 500:1."

45.0,Excluded,ec3,3 - Architectures and Technologies,"Publisher Summary This chapter presents an architectural framework for corporate portals. There is no industry standard per se when it comes to the architecture for corporate portals, although it is fair to note that all credible portals have to offer a minimum and common set of core functionality. However, the exact mechanism for delivering this core functionality set differs among various portal servers. The basic set of functionality needed to implement a successful corporate portal includes a Web interface; presentation services for user interface management; data management services; external data access mechanisms; security, authentication, and personalization; portal development tools; and portal administration and management tools. Data management in this context encompasses content management, search, collaboration, and workflow management functionality. Content management, in turn, addresses content publishing, content structuring, content syndication, content aggregation, content delivery, content directory, and content categorization. Additionally, a portal also typically includes powerful directory functions and a rules engine for enforcing various rules-based services."
46.0,Excluded,ec3,3 - Microsoft Exchange and Windows Server,"Publisher Summary Microsoft Exchange 2003 is integrated with Windows Server and its associated services, and it cannot be deployed correctly without a sound Windows infrastructure and related services. Its most important component is the Windows Active Directory service, which is used for storing almost all aspects of the Microsoft Exchange configuration as well as referencing and addressing the recipients, the distribution groups, or other components. The Domain Name System (DNS) services are also critical, essentially for mail-routing purposes. They are also critical to the correct operation of the Windows Active Directory. Microsoft Exchange 2003 also takes advantage of multinode clustering in a much better way than Exchange 5.5 did. With Windows Server 2003 and the support of eight-node clustering from the Enterprise Edition, a number of clusters are deployed with more than two nodes, with five or six becoming quite common. The chapter also reviews the key Microsoft Exchange needs from the operating system, Windows Server, and discusses the operating-system features of the Windows Server 2003 \{SP1\} release."
47.0,Excluded,ec3,3 - Microsoft's Web Services,"Publisher Summary Microsoftâ€”one of the founding fathers of Web servicesâ€”and \{IBM\} have collaborated extensively when it comes to the development of the pivotal Web servicesâ€“related standards. Given Microsoft's current control of basic corporate \{IT\} infrastructure, especially at the desktop and the Web interface, it is inconceivable to see how Web services can truly flourish without depending on Microsoft technology. Moreover, Microsoft's development tools are widely used and highly popular within the application development community. Consequently, many Web services will be developed using Microsoft tools and deployed on Windows NT, Windows 2000, or Windows 2003. Windows Server 2003 is faster than the prior versions when it comes to file server and Web server transactions. Web services are meant to be relatively quick and easy endeavors. This chapter lists the key issues that really need to be considered in the Microsoft versus non-Microsoft debate vis-Ã -vis Web services. It also discusses the motivations for developing Web services at individual and corporation levels."
49.0,Excluded,ec3,4 - Infrastructure and Security,"Publisher Summary Infrastructure refers to those resources and items required to successfully support and operate information systems. Security refers to policies, procedures, software, and hardware designed to insure that data in information systems are protected against accidental or inappropriate destruction, alteration, or access. Properly supported, infrastructure competency allows an organization to maintain agility in responding to strategic directives and tactical changes. Infrastructure and security together provide the day-to-day operational support for the hardware and software, thus forming a critical component of the organization. Proper management of security requires attention to infrastructure and information system designs, as well as the organization adhering to strict and appropriate personnel practices. Both infrastructure and security are among the many invisible processes and resources required to implement and sustain a successful clinical computing system. Some resources, such as a data center, must be available prior to implementation of these systems; many other resources, such as those supporting security, should be available prior to implementation, but are often deferred until problems occur. Most infrastructure requirements continue and expand after the system is in use. Although organizations can purchase services through outside contracted vendors, those developing skills in their own personnel can use resources more cost effectively, saving as much as 25â€“40%, particularly in areas such as disaster management. In the longer term, the use of contracted services can result in the loss of skills necessary for making strategic decisions, putting into question whether the estimated savings of contracting can be achieved."
50.0,Excluded,ec3,4 - Technologies for Exchange 2003 Deployments,"Publisher Summary Data networks are an essential part of the overall operations of an Exchange 2003 organization. There are three other crucial partsâ€”namely, the storage technologies, the computing power, and the physical memory. A storage-centric approach to Exchange 2003 deployment is becoming popular primarily because of its ability to handle large quantities of data in a more manageable manner through the use of multiple databases per single server instances. This chapter discusses the elements that assist in making the most appropriate choice for the server components and for the deployment. Servers come in many forms and perform many different roles in an Exchange 2003 deployment. Choosing a server involves several steps, such as ensuring that the server infrastructure can actually meet the expected immediate demand and that the server can scale up the processors to accommodate the successful deployment as well as the increased usage of a mission-critical application such as electronic mail or collaboration."
51.0,Excluded,ec3,5 - The Migration Process,"Publisher Summary Migration of any portion of the technology infrastructure of an enterprise is not something to take lightly. Changes to the environment for the sake of change are irresponsible and not tolerated in business anymore. Technology deployment, however, is a real issue. Planning to alter and update the technical environment of an enterprise is a necessity that falls squarely on the shoulders of the Information Technology (IT) professionals. Understanding the reasons for making the changes, as well as planning when to introduce changes, is the focus of the migration process. Technology acquisition or deployment simply for the sake of technology is narrow minded and less than useful to the enterprise. The key is to solve known or anticipated business problems by using technology, while adopting internal and external processes as needed to optimize the technology. Understanding the business needs of the enterprise often requires that \{IT\} staff, as well as other key staff members, review the needs for operational improvements or efficiencies, and then determine the best technology to apply."

In pursuit of new modes of strategic flexibility and fast execution, the e-commerce division transformed its culture around Agile principles and the user experience team adapted its practices to the new paradigm. How would increased velocity affect the quality of the functionality produced? How would time-intensive activities like usability research be affected? This paper presents a case study describing successes and failures while integrating continuous research into Agile projects."
53.0,Excluded,ec3,6 - Effective Global Teams,"Global companies and global products mean global teams. This chapter looks at the organization of these teams and what makes them tick along well. Two challenges are of particular interest to global teams. The most obvious is the need to deal with time zones. As people and companies have matured, teams are more likely to share the pain of time zones rather than assume that one part of the team should be on the phone at 1:30 in the morning, so meetings can be scheduled during one group's work day. More difficultly, global teams must deal with all the issues of collaboration over distanceâ€”maintaining good contact, working through imperfect communications tools, and making sure that all voices are heard. And, they must do all of this through cross-cultural collaboration. Finally, global teams are challenges to not only keep their \{UX\} skills up to date, but to find ways to share knowledge of users around the world."
54.0,Included,included,"7 - Methodology, Application Development, and System Architecture","Publisher Summary This chapter explores methodologies, types of methodologies, process models, application development environments, emulators, and tools. It also discusses integrated development environments (IDE), and hardware and system architecture. Methodology directly addresses the application development and project management of the upcoming project. Two of the methodologies are the waterfall method and the extreme programming model. It is noted that any number of methods can be used to develop a software project. Process model refers to building a commonality of thought processes in scope, features, deliverables, and expectations throughout the system development life cycle. It is also observed that every process model exhibits some level of requirements that need to be met and there is essentially a systems project as a deliverable to answer these requirements. The waterfall method is a deliberate and calculated system of structured development. One of the major characteristic of this type of development is the heavy emphasis on the requirements document. However, extreme programming relies on user stories. This storyboarding of ideas and concepts embraces change more readily and allows for more opportunity in what the customer actually needs and wants."
55.0,Included,included,7 - Planning interMedia Applications,"Publisher Summary This chapter is about planning a rich-media application, from the point of gathering the requirements to testing the implemented system. A rich-media application is part of a more complex information system where interoperability of the component parts might be a significant requirement. The chapter describes various techniques to collect the requirements, plan the stages of the implementation, prototype, and test the system. This is a good point to reflect on what is special about rich-media applications so that one can recognize where there would be problems in development."
56.0,Excluded,ec3,8 - Company Profiles,"Publisher Summary The chapter comprises an alphabetical listing of profiles of major merchant manufacturers of gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrates, devices, and related equipment. The companies that are active in the commercial supply of materials and devices based on GaAs and related semiconductors are profiled in the chapter. The term â€œwaferâ€� used herein is a collective description that includes not only bare substrates but also epitaxial wafers (epiwafers). Manufacturers of GaAs wafers are not restricted to supplying electronic device companies. Many of these wafer suppliers are also active in the optoelectronics business. This market sector is comparable in size to that of the electronics sector but is almost exclusively based on discrete devices rather than integrated circuits (ICs). In terms of geography, the key players in the wafer business are located in the three main regions: Europe, Japan, and North America. However, there are a few additional suppliers in the Rest of the World (ROW) region, particularly in South-East Asia."
58.0,Excluded,ec3,8 - Management Bloopers,"Publisher Summary The main cause of user interface (UI) bloopers in software is the adverse circumstances that are created by the management. This chapter presents common ways that development organizations hinder the development of usable, useful software. Management misconceptions and mistakes that lead to poor product usability fall into two categories: counterproductive attitudes about usability and counterproductive development processes. Bloopers that are discussed in the beginning are related to the management misconceptions and faulty attitudes. â€œTreating \{UI\} as low priorityâ€� is one of the bloopers that is discussed. Its many variations are assuming that usability has low impact on market success, assuming that the \{UI\} is only â€œfonts and colors,â€� assuming that users can adapt to anything, rationalizing, and assigning the graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to junior programmers. A measure to avoid such bloopers is management should make it a high priority to develop products that have high quality user interfaces."
59.0,Excluded,ec3,8 - System Architecture,"Publisher Summary This chapter discusses the technical aspects of implementing a project. In specific, it describes the topologies, scalable solutions down to the component level. The chapter further presents terms and concepts, and hardware options for the projects. It is noted that in most enterprises, the network is implemented during different budgeting periods, different stages of technical expertise, and varying levels of technological maturity. Topology refers to the type of cabling in the physical computer network. It also describes the logical layout of the network and how data is passed through it. Topology essentially includes variety of configurations such as mesh, star, bus, ring, hybrid, and wireless. The hybrid topology is a combination of all the topologies acting together. It is the most common implementation and also has the highest support costs associated with it, as there are several different factors to manage, including technical and asset management. Protocols are a set of agreements among network entities. They are conceptually the same as language is to groups of people."
62.0,Excluded,ec3,A \{DSL\} toolkit for deferring architectural decisions in DSL-based software design,"A number of mature toolkits and language workbenches for DSL-based design have been proposed, making DSL-based design attractive for many projects. These toolkits preselect many architectural decision options. However, in many cases it would be beneficial for DSL-based design to decide for the DSLâ€™s architecture later on in a \{DSL\} project, once the requirements and the domain have been sufficiently understood. We propose a language and a number of \{DSLs\} for DSL-based design and development that combine important benefits of different \{DSL\} toolkits in a unique way. Our approach specifically targets at deferring architectural decisions in DSL-based design. As a consequence, the architect can choose, even late in a \{DSL\} project, for options such as whether to provide the \{DSL\} as one or more external or embedded \{DSLs\} and whether to use an explicit language model or not ."
63.0,Excluded,ec3,A \{DSS\} Design Model for complex problems: Lessons from mission critical infrastructure,"This paper presents a new \{DSS\} Design Model for complex, mission critical decision-making situations and its technical, conceptual, and partial empirical evaluation. The new model was derived from conceptual design research and through a deep qualitative field research study at an electric power utility control centerâ€”a typical arena for â€œwickedâ€� problems. The model suggests an iterative process of theory, simulation, and decision-making interactions. The \{DSS\} Design Model is validated using a tool instantiation, microgrid mini-case, and current research of a \{KMDSS\} for telecommunications. Main findings suggest that broader and more integrated approaches are necessary to design \{DSS\} for complex domains."
64.0,Included,included,A Business Case for Feature-Oriented Requirements Engineering,"Owing to strong market growth for medical devices deployed in critical-care facilities, development organizations in medical engineering must continually look for opportunities to drive engineering efficiency and cost effectiveness. Furthermore, cycle time must decrease, the alignment of clinical workflow is breaking down departmental barriers, and an increased amount of product functionality is being realized in software. To help meet such challenges, adequate requirements engineering is necessary. Toward that end, Syngo (a business unit of the Imaging and Therapy division of Siemens) introduced Feature-Oriented Requirements Engineering (FORE) and developed a business case for using it in the context of a lean engineering program. FORE integrates with other engineering disciplines such as project management, software architecture, and test management. There was an error in the biographical information for Tobias Stenzel. Stenzel's biography should have indicated that he has an MS in industrial engineering and management from the University of Technology Karlsruhe, Germany."
65.0,Included,included,A Capstone Course on Agile Software Development Using Scrum,"In this paper, an undergraduate capstone course in software engineering is described that not only exposes students to agile software development, but also makes it possible to observe the behavior of developers using Scrum for the first time. The course requires students to work as Scrum Teams, responsible for the implementation of a set of user stories defined by a project domain expert playing the role of the Product Owner. During the course, data on project management activities are collected in order to analyze the amount of work completed, compliance with the release and iteration plans, productivity, ability in effort estimation, and the like. The paper discusses the achievement of teaching goals and provides empirical evaluation of students' progress in estimation and planning skills. A summary of lessons learned and recommendations is given, reflecting the issues to be considered when teaching courses in agile software development. Surveys of students have shown that they were overwhelmingly positive about the course, indicating that the course fully met or even exceeded their expectations."
67.0,Excluded,ec3,A Case of White-Tailed Deer Controlling the Woody Vegetation in a Power Line Right-of-Way Located in a Winter Yard,"Publisher Summary The clearing and subsequent vegetation control in power line rights-of-way located in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) winter yards in Eastern Canada and the Northeast United States remain significant environmental issues. The Rigaud white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) yard is located approximately 100 km west of Montreal, Quebec. The yard is bisected in a north-south axis by a 120 kV transmission power line built in 1972. The power line collapsed during a major ice storm in January 1998 and was rebuilt in the summer and fall 1998. In the summer of 1998, a mechanical brush cutting treatment was completed and the vegetation was further damaged by construction activities. By October 2002, numerous woody stems were taller than 2 m. The vegetation was then treated with handheld manual brush cutters. During the winter 2003, the right-of-way provided very little browse, but on several occasions, deer browsing was observed in the right-of-way for long periods. It formulated the hypothesis that deer browsing pressure controlled the residual woody vegetation in the right-of-way. The April 2003 and 2004 browse surveys targeted the stems of three species sought by deer: red-osier dogwood (Cornus stolonifera), American ash (Fraxinus americana) and willows (Salix spp.). Sampling over 200 stems of each species each spring was done. All these residual stems were short and most were missed during the October 2002 treatment. Browsing rates on C. stolonifera, Salix spp. and F. americana were, respectively, 97.3%, 97.3% and 84.9% in 2003, and 96.3%, 97.3% and 89.2% in 2004. These very high-browsing rates indicate that when stems are short and deer density is high, deer can exert a certain control of the woody vegetation in a right-of-way in a deeryard, at least during the first winters following a vegetation control treatment."
68.0,Excluded,ec3,A case study applying process and project alignment methodology,"Software Process Improvement (SPI) is one of the main software development challenges. However, SPI standards and models (CMMI, SPICE) have not been always adopted with success. The current problem is a lack of strategy to implement successfully these standards and models. To undertake this objective is essential observe real life experiences and detect process and project mutual relationships. Without this alignment it will not be possible to find out how process management is really important to achieve organization’s strategic objectives. This paper proposes a methodology that allows the definition, evaluation and improvement of an organization software development process. This proposal, called a Process and Project Alignment Methodology (ProPAM), allows the specification of an organization development process, as well process and project alignment. ProPAM presents the following life cycle: (1) process definition; (2) project definition considering a base process model; (3) project coordination and monitoring and (4) process improvement assessment. This paper also provides an overview of the action plan to be taken within the software organizations that intent to conduct a SPI initiative. This plan includes two distinct phases: (1) specify the development process and (2) analyze projects, starting an SPI effort. In order to evaluate ProPAM, a study case is undertaken. The case study is performed following the action plan and presents all the steps of the ProPAM. Final results show that, when the organization started using ProPAM, process and project alignment reduced project planning time and effort. ProPAM also introduced new organizational practices that result in a SPI program."
69.0,Included,included,A case study for prioritizing features in environments with multiple stakeholders,"In corporations where the focus is a very dynamic business inserted in web environments, agile methods can fully meet almost all needs. However, in some particular companies, there are multiple stakeholders, who represent different interests in prioritizing activities. There is, consequently, a heavy challenge to implement agile methodologies which deal with such conflicts in order to prioritize the features of the system. It is important to focus on higher earned value as possible and consider the technical risks exposed by the development team. These barriers often lead these companies to abandon such agile methods, incorporating an approach of a chaotic work environment. This paper proposes an agile technique for prioritizing features in environments with multiple stakeholders and reports a successful experience in its usage."
70.0,Excluded,ec3,A case study in test management,"Testing is an essential but often under-utilized area of software engineering. A variety of software testing techniques have been developed to effectively identify bugs in source code, yet these techniques are not always fully employed in practice. There are numerous reasons for this, including the difficulty in mastering the complexity of managing all of the test cases for large-scale projects. Test case management involves organizing testing artifacts (e.g., requirements traceability data, test cases, and expected results) in a systematic manner. To be successful, test case management requires a high degree of discipline to accommodate the large volume of artifacts under consideration. This paper presents the results of a case study in centralizing test artifacts in an industrial setting to aid better test management. Several of the challenges in adopting this approach are discussed. In response to these challenges, recommendations on how to better leverage test case management are offered."
71.0,Included,included,A case study of customer communication in globally distributed software product development,"Agile methodologies emphasize the importance of customer and highlight that communication with the customer is seen as a central tenet. Despite the prevalence and benefits associated with globally distributed software development, communication can be much more challenging in such environments due to temporal, geographical and cultural distances. This paper describes results from a case study of customer communication in a globally distributed product development program applying both traditional and agile approaches. Based on the study, the frequency of communication, the content of that communication and engagement with the customer along with a support for rapid decision making among the development teams and the customer groups are important success factors in distributed agile development."
72.0,Included,included,A case study of the implementation of agile methods in a bioinformatics project,"From July 2005 to August 2006, a bioinformatics project experienced a substantial transformation by adopting Scrum and some XP practices. The paper reveals project risks, previous challenges faced by the team and results from this one-year exploratory case study. The paper presents a discussion of the lessons learned from the perspective of both the project manager and the on-site agile advisor, and recommendations on speeding up the adoption process for other projects."
73.0,Included,included,A case study on benefits and side-effects of agile practices in large-scale requirements engineering,"In the software industry, there is a strong shift from traditional phase-based development towards agile methods and practices. This paper reports on a case study aimed at investigating if, and how, agile Requirements Engineering (RE) can remedy the challenges of traditional RE, and what new challenges agile RE may pose. The results from an initial case study with 9 practitioners from a large software development company, which is transitioning towards agile-inspired processes, show that agile practices address some RE challenges such as communication gaps and overscoping, but also cause new challenges, such as striking a good balance between agility and stability, and ensuring sufficient competence in cross-functional development teams."
74.0,Included,included,A case study: Agile development in the community laser-induced incandescence modeling environment (CLiiME),"The multidisciplinary requirements of current computational modeling problems preclude the development of scientific software that is maintained and used by selected scientists. The multidisciplinary nature of these efforts requires the development of large scale software projects established with a wide developer and user base in mind. This article describes some of the software-engineering practices adopted in a scientific-software application for a laser-induced incandescence community model. The project uses an Agile and Test-Driven Development approach to implement the infrastructure for the development of a collaborative model that is to be extended, modified, and used by different researchers. We discuss some of the software-engineering practices that can be exploited through the life of a project, starting with its inception when only a hand full of developers are contributing to the project and the mechanism we have put in place in order to allow the natural expansion of the model."
76.0,Included,included,A Case Study: Introducing eXtreme Programming in a US Government System Development Project,"The US Military's ability to meet its mission critical requirements calls for increased agility in its information technology development process. The purpose of this case study is to better understand how agile principles, specifically eXtreme Programming (XP) practices, can be effectively introduced and implemented into government organizations that have historically embraced the plan-driven traditional software development environment. In particular, we studied the eXtreme Programming process to develop a new capability for USSTRATCOM's premier knowledge management system, SKIWeb. There were several lessons learned that will assist practitioners in future implementations of XP and new research questions emerged that suggest further study."
78.0,Excluded,ec3,A case-study on using an Automated In-process Software Engineering Measurement and Analysis system in an industrial environment,"Automated systems for measurement and analysis are not adopted on a large scale in companies, despite the opportunities they offer. The fear of the “Big Brother” and the lack of reports giving insights into the real adoption process and concrete usages in industry are barriers to this adoption. We report on a case-study on the adoption and long-term usage (2 years of running system) of such a system in a company focusing on the adoption process and the related challenges we encountered."
79.0,Excluded,ec3,A Change-based Approach to Software Evolution,"Software evolution research is limited by the amount of information available to researchers: Current version control tools do not store all the information generated by developers. They do not record every intermediate version of the system issued, but only snapshots taken when a developer commits source code into the repository. Additionally, most software evolution analysis tools are not a part of the day-to-day programming activities, because analysis tools are resource intensive and not integrated in development environments. We propose to model development information as change operations that we retrieve directly from the programming environment the developers are using, while they are effecting changes to the system. This accurate and incremental information opens new ways for both developers and researchers to explore and evolve complex systems."
80.0,Excluded,ec3,A Classification of Refactoring Methods Based on Software Quality Attributes,"Refactoring is the process of improving the design of existing code by changing its internal structure without affecting its external behavior. Refactoring tends to improve software quality by improving design, improving readability and reducing ‘bugs’. There are many different refactoring methods, each having a particular purpose and effect. Consequently, the effect of refactoring methods on software quality attributes may vary. Moreover, it is often unclear to software designers how to use refactoring methods to improve specific quality attributes. In this paper, we propose a classification of refactoring methods based on their measurable effect on software quality attributes. This, in turn, helps software designers choose appropriate refactoring methods that will improve the quality of their designs, based on the design objectives. It also enables them to predict the quality drift caused by using particular refactoring methods."
81.0,Included,included,A cognitive perspective on software development methods: the case of extreme programming,"One of the main dilemmas with which software development teams face is how to choose a software development method that suits the team as well as the organization. This short paper suggests an approach that may help in this process. Specifically, Extreme Programming (XP) is analyzed from a cognitive perspective. We suggest that such an analysis can support software development processes."
82.0,Excluded,ec3,A collaborative platform for integrating and optimising Computational Fluid Dynamics analysis requests,"A Virtual Integration Platform (VIP) is described which provides support for the integration of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis tools into an environment that supports the use of these tools in a distributed collaborative manner. The \{VIP\} has evolved through previous \{EU\} research conducted within the VRShips-ROPAX 2000 (VRShips) project and the current version discussed here was developed predominantly within the \{VIRTUE\} project but also within the \{SAFEDOR\} project. The \{VIP\} is described with respect to the support it provides to designers and analysts in co-ordinating and optimising \{CFD\} analysis requests. Two case studies are provided that illustrate the application of the \{VIP\} within HSVA: the use of a panel code for the evaluation of geometry variations in order to improve propeller efficiency, and the use of a dedicated maritime \{RANS\} code (FreSCo) to improve the wake distribution for the \{VIRTUE\} tanker. A discussion is included detailing the background, application and results from the use of the \{VIP\} within these two case studies as well as how the platform was of benefit during the development and a consideration of how it can benefit \{HSVA\} in the future."
83.0,Included,included,A comparative case study on clients participation in a 'traditional' and in an Agile software company,"Agile literature suggests that the active and continuous participation and involvement of the clients throughout the project is key to building the right product and raise users' satisfaction. However, relatively little research has been made on comparing what makes clients happy in 'traditional' companies that use planed-driven processes and in agile companies. In turn, it's hard to collect and evaluate evidence in favor of either settings. This paper fills in this gap and compares two software development companies in a Nord-European country in respect to client participation and its impact on the clients' satisfaction with the project. One of the companies is agile by its design while the other follows a 'traditional' software development approach. Our study suggests that active clients' participation is not an exclusive attribute of agile projects and that it can be successfully integrated (and implemented) in a 'traditional' project as well. Further, the study shows that by involving clients, software companies have the chance to get higher customer satisfaction, regardless whether or not they implement agile software development processes. Although our study is not quantitative in nature, we think that it is indicative about the impact of the factor ""client's participation"" on the client's satisfaction."
84.0,Excluded,ec3,A comparative review of patient safety initiatives for national health information technology,"Objective To collect and critically review patient safety initiatives for health information technology (HIT). Method Publicly promulgated set of advisories, recommendations, guidelines, or standards potentially addressing safe system design, build, implementation or use were identified by searching the websites of regional and national agencies and programmes in a non-exhaustive set of exemplar countries including England, Denmark, the Netherlands, the USA, Canada and Australia. Initiatives were categorised by type and software systems covered. Results We found 27 patient safety initiatives for \{HIT\} predominantly dealing with software systems for health professionals. Three initiatives addressed consumer systems. Seven of the initiatives specifically dealt with software for diagnosis and treatment, which are regulated as medical devices in England, Denmark and Canada. Four initiatives dealt with blood bank and image management software which is regulated in the USA. Of the 16 initiatives directed at unregulated software, 11 were aimed at increasing standardisation using guidelines and standards for safe system design, build, implementation and use. Three initiatives for unregulated software were aimed at certification in the USA, Canada and Australia. Safety is addressed alongside interoperability in the Australian certification programme but it is not explicitly addressed in the \{US\} and Canadian programmes, though conformance with specific functionality, interoperability, security and privacy requirements may lead to safer systems. England appears to have the most comprehensive safety management programme for unregulated software, incorporating safety assurance at a local healthcare organisation level based on standards for risk management and user interface design, with national incident monitoring and a response function. Conclusions There are significant gaps in the safety initiatives for \{HIT\} systems. Current initiatives are largely focussed on software. With the exception of diagnostic, prognostic, monitoring and treatment software, which are subject to medical device regulations in some countries, the safety of the most common types of \{HIT\} systems such as \{EHRs\} and \{CPOE\} without decision support is not being explicitly addressed in most nations. Appropriate mechanisms for safety assurance are required for the full range of \{HIT\} systems for health professionals and consumers including all software and hardware throughout the system lifecycle. In addition to greater standardisation and oversight to ensure safe system design and build, appropriate implementation and use of \{HIT\} is critical to ensure patient safety."
85.0,Included,included,A comparison of issues and advantages in agile and incremental development between state of the art and an industrial case,"Recent empirical studies have been conducted identifying a number of issues and advantages of incremental and agile methods. However, the majority of studies focused on one model (Extreme Programming) and small projects. To draw more general conclusions we conduct a case study in large-scale development identifying issues and advantages, and compare the results with previous empirical studies on the topic. The principle results are that (1) the case study and literature agree on the benefits while new issues arise when using agile in large-scale and (2) an empirical research framework is needed to make agile studies comparable."
86.0,Included,included,A comparison of model-based and judgment-based release planning in incremental software projects,"Numerous factors are involved when deciding when to implement which features in incremental software development. To facilitate a rational and efficient planning process, release planning models make such factors explicit and compute release plan alternatives according to optimization principles. However, experience suggests that industrial use of such models is limited. To investigate the feasibility of model and tool support, we compared input factors assumed by release planning models with factors considered by expert planners. The former factors were cataloged by systematically surveying release planning models, while the latter were elicited through repertory grid interviews in three software organizations. The findings indicate a substantial overlap between the two approaches. However, a detailed analysis reveals that models focus on only select parts of a possibly larger space of relevant planning factors. Three concrete areas of mismatch were identified: (1) continuously evolving requirements and specifications, (2) continuously changing prioritization criteria, and (3) authority-based decision processes. With these results in mind, models, tools and guidelines can be adjusted to address better real-life development processes."

90.0,Included,included,A comparison of the Essence 1.0 and SPEM 2.0 specifications for software engineering methods,In this paper we present a comparison of the draft Essence 1.0 and SPEM 2.0 specifications for software engineering methods. The comparison is based on results from the REMICS research project where we are defining an agile methodology for model-driven modernization of legacy applications to service clouds.
91.0,Included,included,A conceptual model of client-driven agile requirements prioritization: results of a case study,"Requirements (re)prioritization is an essential mechanism of agile development approaches to maximize the value for the clients and to accommodate changing requirements. Yet, in the agile Requirements Engineering (RE) literature, very little is known about how agile (re)prioritization happens in practice. Conceptual models about this process are missing, which, in turn, makes it difficult for both practitioners and researchers to reason about requirements decision-making at inter-iteration time. We did a multiple case study on agile requirements prioritization methods to yield a conceptual model for understanding the inter-iteration prioritization process. The model is derived by using interview data from practitioners in 8 development organizations. Such a model makes explicit the concepts that are used tacitly in the agile requirements prioritization practice and can be used for structuring future empirical investigations about this topic, and for analyzing, supporting, and improving the process in real-life projects."
92.0,Excluded,ec3,A Conceptual View of Web-Based E-Learning Systems,"Starting from a general framework for web-based e-learning systems that is based on an abstraction layer model, this paper presents a conceptual modelling approach, which captures the modelling of learners, the modelling of courses, the personalisation of courses, and the management of data in e-learning systems. Courses are modelled by outline graphs, which are further refined by some form of process algebra. The linguistic analysis of word fields referring to an application domain helps to set up these course outlines. Learners are modelled by classifying value combinations for their characteristic properties. Each learner type gives rise to intentions as well as rights and obligations in using a learning system. Intentions can be formalised as postconditions, while rights and obligations lead to deontic constraints. The intentions can be used for the personalisation of the learning system to a learner type. Finally, the management of data in an e-learning system is approached on two different levels dealing with the content of individual learning units and the integrated content of the whole system, respectively. This leads to supporting databases and views defined on them."
93.0,Excluded,ec6,A Constructivist Approach to Teaching Software Processes,"Recreating the context in which software processes are developed is difficult in the undergraduate classroom environment. As a result, traditional lecture-based teaching approaches do not necessarily translate into long-term understanding of software processes. To give students a deeper appreciation for the strengths and weaknesses of software process models, we designed the software process simulation game using constructivism as the underlying foundation. In this paper, we discuss the challenges associated with teaching software processes models, provide an overview of the game, detail its mechanics, and discuss the lessons learned from playing the game. Since the game does not involve actual programming or design activities, it can be used effectively for teaching both novice and experienced software engineers."
94.0,Excluded,ec3,A context management architecture for m-commerce applications,"Mobile commerce applications operate in highly dynamic environments with diverse characteristics and interesting challenges. The characteristics and conditions of these environments -called context-, can be exploited to provide adaptive mobile services, in terms of user interface, functionality and content, in order to offer more effective m-commerce. Today, building adaptive mobile services is a complex and time-consuming task due to the lack of standardized methods, tools and architectures for the identification, representation and management of the context. Addressing some of these issues, recent works have provided formal extensions for various stages of the m-commerce application lifecycle, such as extended UML class diagrams for building design models and have used context parameters in order to offer adaptive applications. Using these works as the basis, in this paper we propose a context management architecture, which accommodates the requirements that have been identified for m-commerce applications. The proposed architecture is evaluated in terms of completeness, complexity, performance and utility, and compared against other approaches proposed in the literature regarding its suitability for supporting context-aware m-commerce applications."
95.0,Excluded,ec6,A cross-collegiate analysis of software development course content,"Many undergraduate IT programs recognize that their graduates will find jobs as software developers. As such, software development (analysis and design) courses are often a core requirement of IT undergraduate degree programs. This paper presents an analysis and comparison of the content of software development courses at several colleges and universities. In particular, the software development methodologies presented in the courses are examined. The comparison is based on two main criteria; the development methodologies presented through the textbook assigned to the class, and the development methodologies presented through the class lectures.A software development methodology is ""a recommended collection of phases, procedures, rules, techniques, tools, documentation, management, and training used to develop a system"" (Avison 2003). There are hundreds of software development methodologies. An ongoing debate has existed for several years as to what methodology is best. Prior research has shown that no methodology is best all the time and that practitioners are modifying methodologies to suit their needs. This research shows that IT software development courses have not been modified to reflect current trends in the practical application of development methodologies and students may not be learning the tools and techniques that they need to become successful practitioners. Key inadequacies and the associated pedagogical significance are discussed."
96.0,Excluded,ec6,A cross-program investigation of students' perceptions of agile methods,"Research was conducted on using agile methods in software engineering education. This paper explores the perceptions of students from five different academic levels of agile practices. Information has been gathered through the collection of quantitative and qualitative data over three academic years, and analysis reveals student experiences, mainly positive but also some negative. Student opinions indicate the preference to continue to use agile practices at the workplace if allowed. A way these findings may potentially be extrapolated to the industrial settings is discussed. Finally, this report should encourage other academics considering adoption of agile methods in their computer science or software engineering curricula."
97.0,Excluded,ec3,A Current Assessment of Software Development Effort Estimation,"In most cases, software projects exceed their estimated effort. It is often assumed that inaccurate estimates are the main reason for these overruns. Contrarily, our results show that this assumption is not reasonable in many cases. We conducted a survey to gather data on the current situation of software development effort estimation. Apart from objective criteria, we also asked the participants for their subjective perceptions of the estimates. The participants' perceptions indicate that they do not agree with the objective assessments as 82% perceive their estimate as 'good' despite large overruns and provide reasonable arguments for their perceptions. Furthermore, many projects do not re-estimate the effort due to change requests leading to meaningless comparisons of estimated and actual effort. As a consequence, research needs to find new measures to assess the actual estimation accuracy. Besides the actual estimation process, professionals need to intensify their effort to manage the estimation processes' surroundings."
98.0,Excluded,ec6,A curriculum for agile software development methodologies,"Agile software development methodologies are proliferating in software development organizations. Agile techniques can handle changing business requirements, schedule, cost, personnel turnover in an effective way in organizations. Here, major components of agile software development curriculum are discussed along with suggestions towards making it a successful course of software engineering curriculum."
99.0,Included,included,A decade of agile methodologies: Towards explaining agile software development,"Ever since the agile manifesto was created in 2001, the research community has devoted a great deal of attention to agile software development. This article examines publications and citations to illustrate how the research on agile has progressed in the 10 years following the articulation of the manifesto. Specifically, we delineate the conceptual structure underlying agile scholarship by performing an analysis of authors who have made notable contributions to the field. Further, we summarize prior research and introduce contributions in this special issue on agile software development. We conclude by discussing directions for future research and urging agile researchers to embrace a theory-based approach in their scholarship."
100.0,Excluded,ec3,A decomposition-based approach for service composition with global QoS guarantees,"Service-oriented architecture has offered an opportunity to quickly and independently develop new business applications from the existing services. Given that many services are available with the same function but different quality of service (QoS) properties, and service users have different QoS preferences, the challenge of service composition is to select appropriate service candidates to maximize the overall utility while satisfying a userâ€™s requirements. In this paper, we propose a decomposition-based approach for service composition, in which the utility of a composite service can be computed from the utilities of component services and the constraints of component services can be derived from the constraints of the composite service. Thus, with our approach, it is possible to independently manage the selection of each component service, leading to more scalability and more flexibility for service composition in a dynamic environment. The experiment studies show that our approach can achieve a near-optimal solution with a significantly improved performance in computation time."
101.0,Excluded,ec7,A design rule language for aspect-oriented programming,"Abstract Aspect-oriented programming is known as a technique for modularizing crosscutting concerns. However, constructs aimed to support crosscutting modularity might actually break class modularity. As a consequence, class developers face changeability, parallel development and comprehensibility problems, because they must be aware of aspects whenever they develop or maintain a class. At the same time, aspects are vulnerable to changes in classes, since there is no contract specifying the points of interaction amongst these elements. These problems can be mitigated by using adequate design rules between classes and aspects. We present a design rule specification language and explore its benefits since the initial phases of the development process, specially with the aim of supporting modular development of classes and aspects. We discuss how our language improves crosscutting modularity without breaking class modularity. We evaluate it using a real case study and compare it with other approaches."
102.0,Excluded,ec6,A development environment for distributed synchronous collaborative programming,"While collaborative approaches in the classroom have been shown to be highly beneficial for students of computer science, obstacles inherent in today's academic environment often prevent collocated collaborative approaches from being implemented. One solution to the collocation problem may lie with tools that facilitate distributed collaboration. This paper presents RIPPLE (Remote Interactive Pair Programming and Learning Environment), a development environment for distributed synchronous collaborative programming. RIPPLE is an open source software tool. Initial user tests demonstrate positive responses from students, and the potential for long term learning, motivation, and retention benefits is significant. In addition to its benefits for students, RIPPLE is a tool for computing education researchers who wish to collect data on collaborative programming."
103.0,Excluded,ec3,A development process for usable large scale interactive critical systems: application to satellite ground segments,"While a significant effort is being undertaken by the Human-Computer Interaction community in order to extend current knowledge about how users interact with computing devices and how to design and evaluate new interaction techniques, very little has been done to improve the reliability of software offering such interaction techniques. However, malfunctions and failures occur in interactive systems leading to incidents or accidents that, in aviation for instance, are [22] 80% of the time attributed to human error demonstrating the inadequacy between the system and its operators. As an error may have a huge impact on human life, strong requirements are usually set both on the final system and on the development process itself. Interactive safety-critical systems have to be designed taking into account on an equal basis several properties including usability, reliability and operability while their associated design process is required to handle issues such as scalability, verification, testing and traceability. However, software development solutions in the area of critical systems are not adequate leading to defects especially when the interactive aspects are considered. Additionally, the training program development is always designed independently from the system development leading to operators trained with inadequate material. In this paper we propose a new iterative design process embedding multiple design and modeling techniques (both formal and informal) advocated by HCI and dependable computing domains. These techniques have been adapted and tuned for interactive systems and are used in a synergistic way in order to support the integration of factors such as usability, dependability and operability and at the same time in order to deal with scalability, verification and traceability."
104.0,Excluded,ec3,A disciplined approach to adopting agile practices: the agile adoption framework,"Many organizations aspire to adopt agile processes to take advantage of the numerous benefits that they offer to an organization. Those benefits include, but are not limited to, quicker return on investment, better software quality, and higher customer satisfaction. To date, however, there is no structured process (at least that is published in the public domain) that guides organizations in adopting agile practices. To address this situation, we present the agile adoption framework and the innovative approach we have used to implement it. The framework consists of two components: an agile measurement index, and a four-stage process, that together guide and assist the agile adoption efforts of organizations. More specifically, the Sidky Agile Measurement Index (SAMI) encompasses five agile levels that are used to identify the agile potential of projects and organizations. The four-stage process, on the other hand, helps determine (a) whether or not organizations are ready for agile adoption, and (b) guided by their potential, what set of agile practices can and should be introduced. To help substantiate the “goodness” of the Agile Adoption Framework, we presented it to various members of the agile community, and elicited responses through questionnaires. The results of that substantiation effort are encouraging, and are also presented in this paper."
105.0,Excluded,ec6,A distance learning approach to teaching eXtreme programming,"As university-level distance learning programs become more and more popular, and software engineering courses incorporate eXtreme Programming (XP) into their curricula, certain challenges arise when teaching XP to students who are not physically co-located. In this paper, we present the results of a three-year study of such an online software engineering course targeted to graduate students, and describe some of the specific challenges faced, such as students' aversion to aspects of XP and difficulties in scheduling. We discuss our findings in terms of the course's educational objectives, and present suggestions to other educators who may face similar situations."
106.0,Excluded,ec3,A domain specific language to define gestures for multi-touch applications,"It is increasingly common for software and hardware systems to support touch-based interaction. While the technology to support this interaction is still evolving, common protocols for providing consistent communication between hardware and software are available. However, this is not true for gesture recognition -- the act of translating a series of strokes or touches into a system-recognizable event. Developers often end up writing code for this process from scratch due to the lack of higher-level frameworks for defining new gestures. Gesture recognition can contain a significant amount of work since it often involves complex, platform-specific algorithms. We present a domain-specific language that significantly simplifies the process of defining new gestures and allows them to be used across multiple hardware platforms."
107.0,Excluded,ec3,A dynamic spectrum access network based on cognitive radio,"Dynamic spectrum access technologies based on Cognitive Radio (CR) is under intensive research carried out by the wireless communication society and is expected to solve the problem of spectrum scarcity. However, most enabling technologies related to dynamic spectrum access are considered individually. In this paper, we consider these key technologies jointly and introduce a new implementation scheme for a Dynamic Spectrum Access Network Based on Cognitive Radio (DSAN-BCR). We start with a flexible hardware platform for DSAN-BCR, as well as a flexible protocol structure that dominates the operation of DSAN-BCR. We then focus on the state of the art of key technologies such as spectrum sensing, spectrum resources management, dynamic spectrum access, and routing that are below the network layer in DSAN-BCR, as well as the development of technologies related to higher layers. Last but not the least, we analyze the challenges confronted by these mentioned technologies in DSAN-BCR, and give the perspectives on the future development of these technologies. The DSAN-BCR introduced is expected to provide a system level guidance to alleviate the problem of spectrum scarcity."
108.0,Included,included,A feasible user story tool for agile software development?,"User stories form the heart of the Extreme Programming methodology planning game. In its turn, Extreme Programming is one of the supporting pillars of the wider agile software development process. The user stories form a set of central work products that determine the software development processes. In the spirit of Extreme Programming the production of user stories is kept as simple as possible. Traditionally, user stories are hand written on index cards as they are easy to store, display, rearrange and distribute to the co-located development team. However, virtually all other work products of an application development team are in electronic format, and agile software development is increasingly being adopted by teams working from remote locations. In these circumstances distributed development teams look to software solutions for creating and using user stories. This paper surveys some of the tools that are being used and examines their suitability for the task using a set of requirements. As a result of this investigation the author has produced a prototype user story software tool for Agile Software Development called DotStories. The paper concludes by discussing the features of DotStories and its how closely it can approach the ideal user story software tool. Indeed, the proposition that software tools can ever improve on index cards is considered in the light of experience to date."
109.0,Excluded,ec7,A Feature-Oriented Requirements Modelling Language,"In this paper, we present a feature-oriented requirements modelling language (FORML) for modelling the behavioural requirements of a software product line. FORML aims to support feature modularity and precise requirements modelling, and to ease the task of adding new features to a set of existing requirements. In particular, FORML decomposes a product line’s requirements into feature modules, and provides language support for specifying tightly-coupled features as model fragments that extend and override existing feature modules. We discuss how decisions in the design of FORML affect the evolvability of requirements models, and explicate the specification of intended interactions among related features. We applied FORML to the specification of two feature sets, automotive and telephony, and we discuss how well the case studies exercised the language and how the requirements models evolved over the course of the case studies."
110.0,Included,included,"A fishbowl with piranhas: coalescence, convergence or divergence?","Agile software development practices including XP and Scrum have risen to prominence within the software engineering community over the past ten years. Are agile software development practices converging? Are some practices becoming more integrated and/or more widely adopted than others? In the early 90s there was a convergence of object-oriented design methodologies - is a similar pattern being repeated within the agile software development community? Several years ago conferences featured debates on the number of practices inherent to XP - or for that matter what constituted XP. Is the Agile community on the verge of converging to standardization or do individual practices retain their individually and evangelists/disciples? A somewhat related question is: Can an agile practice be applied out of the box or is some assembly required? What does it take to get agility going in an organization? Does it work as advertised? What practices work and play well with others? Hear the experiences of panelists in their attempts to actually make agile work in the real world. From Crystal, DSDM, FDD, LEAN, Scrum, to XP (and others) - participants will to share their perspectives and experiences. Be warned - this fishbowl will be stocked with piranhas."
111.0,Excluded,ec3,A flexible method for maintaining software metrics data: a universal metrics repository,"A neglected aspect of software measurement programs is what will be done with the metrics once they are collected. Often databases of metrics information tend to be developed as an afterthought, with little, if any concessions to future data needs, or long-term, sustaining metrics collection efforts. A metric repository should facilitate an on-going metrics collection effort, as well as serving as the â€œcorporate memoryâ€� of past projects, their histories and experiences. In order to address these issues, we describe a transformational view of software development that treats the software development process as a series of artifact transformations. Each transformation has inputs and produces outputs. The use of this approach supports a very flexible software engineering metrics repository."
112.0,Excluded,ec3,A flexible model for simulation of software development process,"Inadequate use of project management techniques in software development can be traced to the lack of efficient education strategies for managers [1]. Software development processes are complex and therefore it is hard to predict how changes made to some part of the process can affect the overall outcome of the process. Introducing change in the process is often time consuming and there is no assurance that the change implemented will result in an improvement. Simulation of software development process provides an easy way for managers to test the different configurations of the process and understand the effects of various policies.Using agent directed simulation to mimic the software development process at the individual level also would enable us to introduce a new phase of software development without having to change the simulation code. This simulation would start with a given number of agents initialized by the user. At any point of time, the user may change the number of developers or assign developers on different phases of the software development depending on their performance and capabilities."
113.0,Excluded,ec3,A Flexible Software Process Model,"The development of software products is a complex activitywith a large number of factors involved in definingsuccess. As real-world experimentation is difficult andcostly, researchers have used various techniques in an attemptto model the development process. This field of softwareprocess simulation has received substantial attentionover the last twenty years. The aims have been to betterunderstand the software development process and to mitigatethe problems that continue to occur in the industry byproviding support for management decision making."
114.0,Excluded,ec3,A flexible tool suite for change-aware test-driven development of web applications,"Though Web Applications development fits well with Test-Driven Development, there are some problems that hinder its success. In this demo we present a tool suite to improve TDD; the suite supports the representation of web requirements using a domain-specific language and the automatic generation of interaction tests among others."
115.0,Excluded,ec3,A formal approach to technical debt decision making,"The notion of technical debt attracts significant attention, especially in the context of reconciling architecture and agile development. However, most work on technical debt is still largely informal and if it provides a formalization it is often ad-hoc. In this paper, we provide a detailed, formal analysis of decision making on technical debt in development. Using this formalization, we show that optimal decision making is not effectively computable in real-world situations and provide several well-defined approximations that allow to handle the problem nevertheless in practical situations. Combining these approximations in a single method leads to a light-weight approach that can be effectively applied in iterative software development, including agile approaches."
116.0,Excluded,ec3,A framework for assessing poka-yoke devices,"This study introduces a framework for assessing poka-yoke devices (PD), encompassing both those designed for quality control (referred to as quality PD) and those designed to control hazards to health and safety at work (referred to as safety PD). The framework assesses the processes of the design, operation and maintenance of PD, rather than the outcomes of these processes. The development of the framework involved three stages: (a) defining 15 attributes of PD, identifying those that provide fail-safe characteristics and those that inform best practices in design, implementation and maintenance; (b) defining what the set of evidence and what the sources of evidence should be for assessing the existence of each attribute; the sources include documents, interviews, observations and a meeting to discuss the results of the assessment with company representatives; and (c) defining a scoring system to express the results of the assessment. The application of the framework is illustrated by means of assessing four PD; two of them being concerned with quality and two with safety."
117.0,Excluded,ec3,A framework for efficient and rapid development of cross-platform audio applications,"In this article, we present CLAM, a C++ software framework, that offers a complete development and research platform for the audio and music domain. It offers an abstract model for audio systems and includes a repository of processing algorithms and data types as well as all the necessary tools for audio and control input/output. The framework offers tools that enable the exploitation of all these features to easily build cross-platform applications or rapid prototypes for media processing algorithms and systems. Furthermore, included ready-to-use applications can be used for tasks such as audio analysis/synthesis, plug-in development, feature extraction or metadata annotation. CLAM represents a step forward over other similar existing environments in the multimedia domain. Nevertheless, it also shares models and constructs with many of those. These commonalities are expressed in the form of a metamodel for multimedia processing systems and a design pattern language."
118.0,Excluded,ec7,A framework for role-based feature management in software product line organizations,"Product line engineering requires changes in approaching software development. Two main processes are to be established: creating a reusable infrastructure, and utilizing it for developing products. In practice, these two processes cannot strictly be separated as product enhancements are requested frequently by customers and a changeable infrastructure is essential to react on market needs. Thus, various approaches, such as proactive, reactive, or agile, have been introduced to handle changes. At a finer level of granularity, however, changes comprise many activities with variable duration and thus result in sets of concurrent and overlapping software development activities. This paper, therefore, investigates changes in more detail and assumes that provisioning comprehensive information on changes and respective states are crucial to organizations for keeping a software product line manageable. As features are a common notion used in software engineering to reflect customer requirements, the paper proposes a conceptual framework for managing feature information and for defining role-specific views throughout all life cycle processes. Its concepts have been derived from an industrial context."
119.0,Excluded,ec3,A framework for supporting dynamic systems co-evolution,"Businesses and their supporting software evolve to accommodate the constant revision and re-negotiation of commercial goals, and to intercept the potential of new technology. We have adopted the term co-evolution to describe the concept of the business and the software evolving sympathetically, but at potentially different rates. More generally, we extend co-evolution to accommodate wide-informatics systems, that are assembled from parts that co-evolve with each other and their environment, and whose behavior is potentially emergent. Typically these are long-lived systems in which dynamic co-evolution, whereby a system evolves as part of its own execution in reaction to both expected and unexpected events, is the only feasible option for change. Examples of such systems include continuously running business process models, sensor nets, grid applications, self-adapting/tuning systems, peer-to-peer routing systems, control systems, autonomic systems, and pervasive computing applications.The contribution of this paper comprises: a study of the intrinsic nature of dynamic co-evolving systems; the derivation of a set of intrinsic requirements; a description of a model and a set of technologies, new and extant, to meet these intrinsic requirements; and illustrations of how these technologies may be implemented within an architecture description language (ArchWare ADL) and a conventional programming language (Java). The model and technologies address three topics: structuring for dynamic co-evolution, incremental design, and adapting dynamic co-evolving systems. The combination yields a framework that can describe the system’s specification, the executing software and the reflective evolutionary mechanisms within a single computational domain in which all three may evolve in tandem."
120.0,Included,included,A framework for the integration of user centered design and agile software development processes,"Agile and user centered design integration (AUCDI) is of significant interest to researchers who want to achieve synergy and eliminate limitations of each. Currently, there are no clear principles or guidelines for practitioners to achieve successful integration. In addition, substantial differences exist between agile and UCD approaches which pose challenges to integration attempts. As a result, practitioners developed individual integration strategies. However, success evaluation of current AUCDI attempts has been anecdotal. Moreover, AUCDI attempts cannot be generalized to provide guidance and assistance to other projects or organizations with different needs.My thesis aims to provide a Software Process Improvement (SPI) framework for AUCDI by providing generic guidelines and practices for organizations aspiring to achieve AUCDI in order to address AUCDI challenges including: introducing systematicity and structure into AUCDI, assessing AUCDI processes, and accommodating project and organizational characteristics."
121.0,Excluded,ec3,A framework of distributed pair programming system,"Pair programming is a programming practice in which two programmers use one computer to work together on the same analysis, design, and programming of the same software. Distributed pair programming supports two programmers to work on the same task from different locations. This paper first reviews the existing distributed pair programming tools, and then proposes some basic requirements of this kind of system. Finally, a framework of distributed pair programming system is presented. The framework allows not only to use the same editor between the pairs, but also to support different editors or developing environments between them. Â©2009 IEEE."
122.0,Excluded,ec3,"A framework to support the evaluation, adoption and improvement of agile methods in practice","Agile methods are often seen as providing ways to avoid overheads typically perceived as being imposed by traditional software development environments. However, few organizations are psychologically or technically able to take on an agile approach rapidly and effectively. Here, we describe a number of approaches to assist in such a transition. The Agile Software Solution Framework (ASSF) provides an overall context for the exploration of agile methods, knowledge and governance and contains an Agile Toolkit for quantifying part of the agile process. These link to the business aspects of software development so that the business value and agile process are well aligned. Finally, we describe how these theories are applied in practice with two industry case studies using the Agile Adoption and Improvement Model (AAIM)."
123.0,Excluded,ec7,A functional framework for agent-based models of exchange,"We propose a functional framework for studying agent-based dynamical models of exchange. The framework consists of a notation and of a number of elementary definitions. We argue that â€“ in comparison to narrative descriptions â€“ the framework has a number of advantages: (1) it allows one to express precisely the relationships between the classical notion of general equilibrium and agent-based models of exchange; (2) it supports computational descriptions of models of exchange which can be unambiguously implemented; (3) it assists the numerical investigation of such models by providing a specific set of elementary notions and computational primitives. These can be used to deduce model properties and to setup â€œcrucialâ€� numerical experiments for validating model implementations. In a companion paper, we apply the framework to specify and study a model of exchange in which multiple equilibrium prices coexist and prices evolve according to a simple trading scheme and to a generic genetic rule."
124.0,Included,included,A general model of software architecture design derived from five industrial approaches,"We compare five industrial software architecture design methods and we extract from their commonalities a general software architecture design approach. Using this general approach, we compare across the five methods the artifacts and activities they use or recommend, and we pinpoint similarities and differences. Once we get beyond the great variance in terminology and description, we find that the five approaches have a lot in common and match more or less the â€œidealâ€� pattern we introduced. From the ideal pattern we derive an evaluation grid that can be used for further method comparisons."
125.0,Excluded,ec3,A genetic algorithm approach for solving the daily photograph selection problem of the \{SPOT5\} satellite,"This article addresses the combinatorial optimization problem of managing earth observation satellites (EOSs) such as the French SPOT5, which is concerned with selecting on each day a subset of a set of candidate photographs. The problem has a significant economic importance due to its high initial investment cost that exists in these instruments and its solution difficulty resulting from the large solution space, making it an attractive research area. This article proposes a genetic algorithm (GA) for solving the \{SPOT5\} selection problem using a new genome representation for maximizing not only a single objective as profit but a multi-criteria objective that includes the number of acquired photographs. Test results of our proposed \{GA\} show that it finds optimal solutions effectively for moderate size problems and obtains better results for two large benchmark instances coded 1403 and 1504 in the literature. Also, we verify the result that the best known value in the literature for problem coded 1401 is an optimal value."
126.0,Excluded,ec3,A genetic algorithm for solving no-wait flexible flow lines with due window and job rejection,"This paper addresses a no-wait multi-stage flexible flow shop problem. There are n jobs to complete in a predetermined due window; hence, some jobs may be rejected. A mixed integer linear programming model with the objective of maximizing the total profit gained from scheduled jobs is introduced. Since the problem is NP-hard and difficult to find an optimal solution in a reasonable computational time, an efficient genetic algorithm is presented as the solution procedure. A heuristic mechanism is proposed to use in each generation of the genetic algorithms to assure the feasibility and superior quality of the obtained solutions. Computational results show that the presented approach performs considerably in terms of both quality of solutions and required runtimes."
127.0,Excluded,ec7,A Goal Model Elaboration for Localizing Changes in Software Evolution," Software evolution is an essential activity that adapts existing software to changes in requirements. Localizing the impact of changes is one of the most efficient strategies for successful evolution. We exploit requirements descriptions in order to extract loosely coupled components and localize changes for evolution. We define a process of elaboration for the goal model that extracts a set of control loops from the requirements descriptions as components that constitute extensible systems. We regard control loops to be independent components that prevent the impact of a change from spreading outside them. To support the elaboration, we introduce two patterns: one to extract control loops from the goal model and another to detect possible conflicts between control loops. We experimentally evaluated our approach in two types of software development and the results demonstrate that our elaboration technique helps us to analyze the impact of changes in the source code and prevent the complexity of the code from increasing."

Configuration management tools have been used to support DevOps. However, in this paper we investigate which Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSA) have been employed in developing and deploying modern web applications and how these KSAs support DevOps. By applying a qualitative analysis approach, namely grounded theory, to three web application development projects, we discover that the KSAs for both Software Development and IT Operator practitioners support the four perspectives of DevOps: collaboration culture, automation, measurement, and sharing."

One such environment is COLLECE, a groupware system to support collaborative edition, compilation and execution of programs in a synchronous distributed fashion, which includes advanced tools for communication, coordination and workspace awareness. The article analyses firstly some usability and design issues, discussing strengths and weaknesses of the system as a basis for the development of groupware tools to support collaborative programming. Then, the focus is on a number of experimental activities carried out. \{COLLECE\} was used to conduct a set of experimental activities about work productivity and program quality when comparing the activity of pair and solo programmers, and to analyse potential associations between ways of working and collaborating, and specific characteristics of the programs produced."
130.0,Included,included,A guide to agile development of interactive software with a â€œUser Objectivesâ€�-driven methodology,"This paper presents the InterMod methodology. By combining the widely accepted Agile Methods, Model-Driven Developments and User-Centred Design it allows us to develop high-quality interactive applications. As a main characteristic, it plans and organises the software project as a series of iterations that are guided by the User Objectives in an agile and user-centred manner. At each iteration, the software development work can be distributed to different teams according to some developmental and integration activities. Each activity is driven by models that are validated by a multidisciplinary team composed of developers and users. The requirements are incrementally collected and formalised by means of models based on user-centred design. Besides, the Semantically Enriched Humanâ€“Computer Interaction model is proposed to speed up project validation. This model enriches a humanâ€“computer interaction model with some visual characteristics and the application semantic. Thus, the enriched model provides enough information to generate prototypes so users and developers can easily validate this model. Diagram project is a real case study that is used to illustrate the application of the InterMod methodology through the whole paper."

134.0,Excluded,ec3,A Hybrid Set of Complexity Metrics for Large-Scale Object-Oriented Software Systems,"Large-scale object-oriented (OO) software systems have recently been found to share global network characteristics such as small world and scale free, which go beyond the scope of traditional software measurement and assessment methodologies. To measure the complexity at various levels of granularity, namely graph, class (and object) and source code, we propose a hierarchical set of metrics in terms of coupling and cohesion — the most important characteristics of software, and analyze a sample of 12 open-source OO software systems to empirically validate the set. Experimental results of the correlations between cross-level metrics indicate that the graph measures of our set complement traditional software metrics well from the viewpoint of network thinking, and provide more effective information about fault-prone classes in practice."
135.0,Included,included,A Hybrid Software Architecture Evaluation Method for FDD - An Agile Process Model,"The software development industry suffers from the delay in project completion time due to heavy documentation requirements of traditional process models. To overcome these delays, agile process models are getting a wide acceptance and popularity in the industry. The beauty of these models is light weight documentation and heavy intercommunications. Due to an emphasis of these models on rapid development, there is an ever increasing need of architecture evaluation. A single software architecture evaluation method (SAEM) capable of preserving the agility does not exist at the moment. In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid SAEM for feature driven development (FDD) agile process model. The proposed SAEM is hybrid of quality attribute workshop (QAW), architecture tradeoff analysis method (ATAM) and active review for intermediate designs (ARID)."
137.0,Excluded,ec7,"A journey to highly dynamic, self-adaptive service-based applications","Future software systems will operate in a highly dynamic world. Systems will need to operate correctly despite of unespected changes in factors such as environmental conditions, user requirements, technology, legal regulations, and market opportunities. They will have to operate in a constantly evolving environment that includes people, content, electronic devices, and legacy systems. They will thus need the ability to continuously adapt themselves in an automated manner to react to those changes. To realize dynamic, self-adaptive systems, the service concept has emerged as a suitable abstraction mechanism. Together with the concept of the service-oriented architecture (SOA), this led to the development of technologies, standards, and methods to build service-based applications by flexibly aggregating individual services. This article discusses how those concepts came to be by taking two complementary viewpoints. On the one hand, it evaluates the progress in software technologies and methodologies that led to the service concept and SOA. On the other hand, it discusses how the evolution of the requirements, and in particular business goals, influenced the progress towards highly dynamic self-adaptive systems. Finally, based on a discussion of the current state of the art, this article points out the possible future evolution of the field."
138.0,Included,included,A knowledge-based framework for extracting components in agile systems development,"Considerable strides have been made in the use of components in software development. Many proprietary enterprise resource planning (ERP) software environments use modular components to develop and customize “best practices” to meet a specific organizational need. In agile application development, many developers and users are asked to design systems in a short period of time. These applications may use components that are embedded in software repositories. The challenge then is how to select the right software components (data and procedures) to meet an application requirement. Although experienced developers may select and customize components to meet the needs of an application, such expertise may not be available to other applications. This paper presents a knowledge-based framework to select and customize software components and demonstrates its value in deriving quality specifications, even when the developers are relatively inexperienced."
139.0,Excluded,ec3,A Lagrangian heuristic for sprint planning in agile software development,"Abstract Agile methods for software development promote iterative design and implementation. Most of them divide a project into functionalities, called user stories; at each iteration, often called a sprint, a subset of user stories are developed. The sprint planning phase is critical to ensure the project success, but it is also a difficult problem because several factors impact on the optimality of a sprint plan, e.g., the estimated complexity, business value, and affinity of the user stories to be included in each sprint. In this paper we present an approach for sprint planning based on an integer linear programming model. Given the estimates made by the project team and a set of development constraints, the optimal solution of the model is a sprint plan that maximizes the business value perceived by users. Solving to optimality the model by a general-purpose \{MIP\} solver, such as \{IBM\} Ilog Cplex, takes time and for some instances even finding a feasible solution requires too large computing times for an operational use. For this reason we propose an effective Lagrangian heuristic based on a relaxation of the proposed model and some greedy and exchange algorithms.

Traffic grooming techniques aggregate low-bandwidth traffic streams onto high-bandwidth wavelength channels. In this paper, we study the optimization problem of grooming the static traffic in mesh Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) over WDM networks. The problem is formulated as a constrained integer linear programming problem and an innovative optimization objective is developed as network profit optimization. The routing cost in the SONET and WDM layers as well as the revenue generated by accepting SONET traffic demands are modelled. Through the optimization process, SONET traffic demands will be selectively accepted based on the profit (i.e., the excess of revenue over network cost) they generate. Consiering the complexity of the network optimization problem, a decomposition approach using Lagrangian relaxation is proposed. The overall relaxed dual problem is decomposed into routing and wavelength assignment and SONET traffic routing sub-problems. The subgradient approach is used to optimize the derived dual function by updating the Lagrange multipliers. To generate a feasible network routing scheme, a heuristic algorithm is proposed based on the dual solution. A systematic approach to obtain theoretical performance bounds is presented for an arbitrary topology mesh network. This is the first time that such theoretical performance bounds are obtained for SONET traffic grooming in mesh topology networks. The optimization results of sample networks indicate that the roposed algorithm achieves good sub-optimal solutions. Finally, the influence of various network parameters is studied."
141.0,Excluded,ec7,A language for end-user web augmentation: Caring for producers and consumers alike,"Web augmentation is to the Web what augmented reality is to the physical world: layering relevant content/layout/navigation over the existing Web to customize the user experience. This is achieved through JavaScript (JS) using browser weavers (e.g., Greasemonkey). To date, over 43 million of downloads of Greasemonkey scripts ground the vitality of this movement. However, Web augmentation is hindered by being programming intensive and prone to malware. This prevents end-users from participating as both producers and consumers of scripts: producers need to know JS, consumers need to trust JS. This article aims at promoting end-user participation in both roles. The vision is for end-users to prosume (the act of simultaneously caring for producing and consuming) scripts as easily as they currently prosume their pictures or videos. Encouraging production requires more “natural” and abstract constructs. Promoting consumption calls for augmentation scripts to be easier to understand, share, and trust upon. To this end, we explore the use of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) by introducing Sticklet. Sticklet is an internal DSL on JS, where JS generality is reduced for the sake of learnability and reliability. Specifically, Web augmentation is conceived as fixing in existing web sites (i.e., the wall) HTML fragments extracted from either other sites or Web services (i.e., the stickers). Sticklet targets hobby programmers as producers, and computer literates as consumers. From a producer perspective, benefits are threefold. As a restricted grammar on top of JS, Sticklet expressions are domain oriented and more declarative than their JS counterparts, hence speeding up development. As syntactically correct JS expressions, Sticklet scripts can be installed as traditional scripts and hence, programmers can continue using existing JS tools. As declarative expressions, they are easier to maintain, and amenable for optimization. From a consumer perspective, domain specificity brings understandability (due to declarativeness), reliability (due to built-in security), and “consumability” (i.e., installation/enactment/sharing of Sticklet expressions are tuned to the shortage of time and skills of the target audience). Preliminary evaluations indicate that 77% of the subjects were able to develop new Sticklet scripts in less than thirty minutes while 84% were able to consume these scripts in less than ten minutes. Sticklet is available to download as a Mozilla add-on."
142.0,Excluded,ec3,A language for formal design of embedded intelligence research systems,"The construction of complex artifacts of artificial intelligence requires large-scale system integration and collaboration. System architectures are a central issue to enable this process. To develop these, hypotheses must be formulated, validated and evolved. We therefore present Systematica 2d, a formalism suitable for both flexible description of hierarchical architecture concepts as well as functional design of the resulting system integration process. We motivate the approach and relate it to other formal descriptions by means of a new formalization measure. It consists of a set of criteria to evaluate how well a formalism supports the expression, construction and reuse of intelligent systems. Systematica 2d is compared with existing formalization languages under this measure and shown to have at least their level of expression. In addition, the system properties of incremental composition, partial testability and global deadlock-free operation are formally defined and proven in the formalism."

144.0,Excluded,ec3,A large scale exploratory analysis of software vulnerability life cycles,"Software systems inherently contain vulnerabilities that have been exploited in the past resulting in significant revenue losses. The study of vulnerability life cycles can help in the development, deployment, and maintenance of software systems. It can also help in designing future security policies and conducting audits of past incidents. Furthermore, such an analysis can help customers to assess the security risks associated with software products of different vendors. In this paper, we conduct an exploratory measurement study of a large software vulnerability data set containing 46310 vulnerabilities disclosed since 1988 till 2011. We investigate vulnerabilities along following seven dimensions: (1) phases in the life cycle of vulnerabilities, (2) evolution of vulnerabilities over the years, (3) functionality of vulnerabilities, (4) access requirement for exploitation of vulnerabilities, (5) risk level of vulnerabilities, (6) software vendors, and (7) software products. Our exploratory analysis uncovers several statistically significant findings that have important implications for software development and deployment."
145.0,Included,included,A layer-based method for rapid software development,"A layer-based method for rapid software development is presented in this paper. It follows the guidelines suggested by Extreme Programming (XP) that require highly expressive programming languages (i.e., Java) and \{CASE\} tools. As in XP, this method addresses rapid software development for small- or medium-sized projects. Further, for effective guidance on the development, it directs the construction of system components by imposing an architecture-based concept of layered specification and construction of these components through its activities. Since the method follows the guidelines suggested by \{XP\} and supports effective guidance by a layered development of architectural components, team productivities can be greatly enhanced with less (but effective) overheads on specification work. The method uses \{UML\} and Petri nets as its modeling tool; for illustration, an example application is presented that specifies and directs the development of a software system with business-oriented Internet services."
146.0,Excluded,ec7,A Legal Cross-References Taxonomy for Identifying Conflicting Software Requirements,"Companies must ensure their software complies with relevant laws and regulations to avoid the risk of costly penalties, lost reputation, and brand damage resulting from noncompliance. Laws and regulations contain internal cross-references to portions of the same legal text, as well as cross-references to external legal texts. These cross-references introduce ambiguities, exceptions, as well as other challenges to regulatory compliance. Requirements engineers need guidance as to how to address cross-references in order to comply with the requirements of the law. Herein, we analyze each external cross-reference within the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule to determine whether a cross-reference either: introduces a conflicting requirement, a conflicting definition, and/or refines an existing requirement. Herein, we propose a legal cross-reference taxonomy to aid requirements engineers in classifying cross-references as they specify . Analyzing cross-references enables us to address conflicting requirements that may otherwise thwart legal compliance. We identify five sets of conflicting compliance requirements and recommend strategies for resolving these conflicts."
147.0,Excluded,ec3,A lightweight and flexible process for designing intuitive error handling and effective error messages,"Unintuitive error handling and ineffective messages result in lost revenue, wasted time, and unsatisfied customers. Yet, error conditions are often considered edge cases. As a result, a focus on error conditions is usually left until late in the software design and development cycle and is sometimes limited to just resolving unexpected test case failures. This paper outlines a process that enables software development teams to collaborate more effectively to produce intuitive error handling and useful error messages. The process is structured: there are artifacts to produce and rituals to step through. However, the process is also lightweight and flexible. In addition, the process scales well for small and large projects. This paper also describes the benefits that the IBM® DB2® for Linux®, UNIX®, and Windows® (henceforth referred to as IBM DB2 LUW) software development team discovered after adopting this process, including better quality messages, a shorter and easier-to-manage translation cycle, and improved integration between error messages and related product documentation."
148.0,Included,included,A lightweight framework for describing software practices,"In order to maximise software project outcomes, software organisations adapt development methodologies and implement practices in a way that is appropriate for project contexts. This suggests that â€˜Best Practiceâ€™ is context-dependent. To better understand the contextual nature of best practice, we want to explore how organisations actually go about achieving software objectives. We require a research framework that captures this information in a way that makes no assumptions about practices and that is descriptive in nature. We have developed a framework based on the perspective that practices exist to meet specific objectives. We have experimented with the framework by using it to capture the practices of three New Zealand organisations and by application to an idealised \{XP\} process. Our capture of organisational practices revealed interesting mechanisms for further study, including a dependence upon informal practices linked with strong communication and the idea of â€˜pushâ€™ versus â€˜pullâ€™ for information elicitation. Our capture of \{XP\} exposed some context-dependent risks."
149.0,Included,included,A literature review of agile practices and their effects in scientific software development,"The nature of scientific research and the development of scientific software have similarities with processes that follow the agile manifesto: responsiveness to change and collaboration are of the utmost importance. But how well do current scientific software development processes match the practices found in agile development methods, and what are the effects of using agile practices in such processes? In order to investigate this, we conduct a literature review, focusing on evaluating the agility present in a selection of scientific software projects. Both projects with intentionally agile practices and projects with a certain degree of agile elements are taken into consideration. In the agility assessment, we define and utilize an agile mapping chart. The elements of the mapping chart are based on Scrum and XP, thus covering two of the most prominent agile reference models. We compared the findings of the literature review to results of a previously conducted survey. The comparison indicates that scientific software development projects adopting agile practices perceive their testing to be better than average. No difference to average projects was perceived regarding requirements-related activities. Future work includes an in-depth case study to further investigate the existence and impact of agility in three large scientific software projects, ultimately aiming at a better understanding of the particularities involved in developing scientific software.

153.0,Excluded,ec3,A Means of Establishing Traceability Based on a UML Model in Business Application Development,"This paper describes an easy means of setting traceability in business application artifacts. The traceability is established for completeness verification and impact analysis. There are thousands of functions and screens in real business applications. It is difficult to establish suitable links from these many elements. In addition, there is a constraint that the workload of setting traceability links should be small. This paper proposes a two-step approach to establish traceability in artifacts. In the first step, the software model defines traceability. In the second step, a developer him/herself sets up traceability links during the design phase. The purpose of the first step is to restrict of the set of linkable elements, while the purpose of the second step is to establish links according to the developer's intentions. We also devise the second step in two points. The first point is to make a developer set up links while he/she is working on the design. The second point is appropriate categorization to reduce the number of candidate links. We also propose a support tool for setting up links. The approach and tool decrease the developer's workload. This paper provides details and evaluation on this model-based approach and tool."

A novel fuzzy prioritization method, which derives crisp priorities (criteria weights and scores of alternatives) from consistent and inconsistent fuzzy comparison matrices, is also proposed. The applicability of the proposed model is demonstrated in a government purchase digital video recorder (DVR) system project study. The stability tests indicate the advantages of the proposal model in determining the value of model. Importantly, the proposed model can provide decision makers a reference material, making it highly applicable for academic and commercial purposes."

This paper proposes a collaborative method to identify innovation factors from a successful project that led to innovation. Our method uses group storytelling to capture, organize, and share organizational knowledge. We then use a set of innovation indicators to extract collaboratively innovation features from the gathered knowledge.

158.0,Excluded,ec3,A method for forecasting defect backlog in large streamline software development projects and its industrial evaluation,"Context Predicting a number of defects to be resolved in large software projects (defect backlog) usually requires complex statistical methods and thus is hard to use on a daily basis by practitioners in industry. Making predictions in simpler and more robust way is often required by practitioners in software engineering industry. Objective The objective of this paper is to present a simple and reliable method for forecasting the level of defect backlog in large, lean-based software development projects. Method The new method was created as part of an action research project conducted at Ericsson. In order to create the method we have evaluated multivariate linear regression, expert estimations and analogy-based predictions w.r.t. their accuracy and ease-of-use in industry. We have also evaluated the new method in a life project at one of the units of Ericsson during a period of 21&#xa0;weeks (from the beginning of the project until the release of the product). Results The method for forecasting the level of defect backlog uses an indicator of the trend (an arrow) as a basis to forecast the level of defect backlog. Forecasts are based on moving average which combined with the current level of defect backlog was found to be the best prediction method (Mean Magnitude of Relative Error of 16%) for the level of future defect backlog. Conclusion We have found that ease-of-use and accuracy are the main aspects for practitioners who use predictions in their work. In this paper it is concluded that using the simple moving average provides a sufficiently-good accuracy (much appreciated by practitioners involved in the study). We also conclude that using the indicator (forecasting the trend) instead of the absolute number of defects in the backlog increases the confidence in our method compared to our previous attempts (regression, analogy-based, and expert estimates)."

Our method is based on a process domain metamodel that contains the main concepts of information systems engineering process field. This process domain metamodel helps selecting the needed metamodel concepts for a particular situational context. Our method is also based on patterns to refine the process metamodel.

The current eye-tracking devices and software support this research situation. Applications of eye-tracking in the research of collaborative tasks have been rare to date. We present a methodological framework of a research in which visual attention of pair programmers with a single display has been studied. We discuss the challenges of such research when conducted in real-world settings and the requirements on the eye-tracking setups. The hardware setups and software solutions to the problems of acquisition and synchronization of streams of eye-tracking data are presented.

162.0,Excluded,ec3,A Methodology for Assessing Agile Software Development Methods,"Agile methods provide an organization or a team with the flexibility to adopt a selected subset of principles and practices based on their culture, their values, and the types of systems that they develop. More specifically, every organization or team implements a customized agile method, tailored to better accommodate its needs. However, the extent to which a customized method supports the organizational objectives, i.e. the `goodness' of that method, is questionable. Existing agile assessment approaches focus on comparative analyses, or are limited in scope and application. In this research, we propose a structured, systematic, and comprehensive approach to assessing the `goodness' of agile methods. We examine an agile method based on (1) its adequacy, (2) the capability of the organization to support the adopted principles and practices specified by the method, and (3) the method's effectiveness. We propose the Objectives, Principles and Practices (OPP) Framework to guide our assessment. The Framework identifies (1) objectives of the agile philosophy, (2) principles that support the objectives, (3) practices that are reflective of the principles, (4) linkages among the objectives, principles and practices, and (5) indicators for assessing the extent to which an organization supports the implementation and the effectiveness of that practice.

Interestingly, the highest-level modes of the pattern can serve as a generic behavioural interface for all features that adhere to the pattern. We have applied the pattern in modelling the behavioural requirements of 19 automotive features that were specified in 5 production-grade requirements documents.

Reduced time-to-market is a key response to competitive threats in the commercial sphere, and rapid response in deploying military systems may save lives in a geopolitical environment characterized by rapidly emerging and ever-changing physical threats. Agile/lean development methodologies show promise in providing the desired schedule acceleration, but it can be difficult for planners to determine the effects of these factors on schedule duration, and to make appropriate choices to optimize project performance. The Constructive Rapid Application Development Model (CORADMO) attempts to quantify the effects of key schedule drivers, and thus enable planners to estimate the relative schedule that will result from varying these parameters."

By interviewing 25 software designers and using content analysis and explanation building as our analysis technique, we provide qualitative and quantitative results that highlight aspects of rational and naturalistic decision making in software design. Our qualitative multi-case study results in a model of design decision making to answer the question: how do software designers make design decisions? We find the structure of the design problem determines the aspects of rational and naturalistic decision making used. The more structured the design decision, the less a designer considers options."

170.0,Excluded,ec3,A model-driven approach to automate the propagation of changes among Architecture Description Languages,"As it is widely recognized, a universal notation accepted by any software architect cannot exist. This caused a proliferation of architecture description languages (ADLs) each focussing on a specific application domain, analysis type, or modelling environment, and with its own specific notations and tools. Therefore, the production of a software architecture description often requires the use of multiple ADLs, each satisfying some stakeholder’s concerns. When dealing with multiple notations, suitable techniques are required in order to keep models in a consistent state. Several solutions have been proposed so far but they lack in convergence and scalability. In this paper, we propose a convergent change propagation approach between multiple architectural languages. The approach is generic since it depends neither on the notations to synchronize nor on their corresponding models. It is implemented within the Eclipse modelling framework and we demonstrate its usability and scalability by experimenting it on well known architectural languages."

173.0,Excluded,ec3,A neural network model for the assessment of partners’ performance in virtual enterprises,"In response to increasing international competition, enterprises have been investigating new ways of cooperating with each other to cope with today’s unpredictable market behaviour. Advanced developments in information & communication technology (ICT) enabled reliable and fast cooperation to support real-time alliances. In this context, the virtual enterprise (VE) represents an appropriate cooperation alternative and competitive advantage for the enterprises. VE is a temporary network of independent companies or enterprises that can quickly bring together a set of core competencies to take advantage of market opportunity. In this emerging business model of VE, the key to enhancing the quality of decision making in the partner companies’ performance evaluation function is to take advantage of the powerful computer-related concepts, tools and technique that have become available in the last few years. This paper attempts to introduce a neural network model, which is able to contribute to the extrapolation of the probable outcomes based on available pattern of events in a virtual enterprise. Quality, delivery and progress were selected as determinant factors effecting the performance assessment. Considering the features of partner performance assessment and neural network models, a back-propagation neural network that includes a two hidden layers was used to evaluate the partner performance."

Therefore, it is vital to address the critical determinants of effective innovation management within an organizational context, hence called organizational innovation. Based on some existing frameworks of managing organizational innovation, several key determinants can be identified. Using industrial survey data, we then proposed and used a neural network-based approach to quantify the connectivity between each of these determinants and organizational innovation. First, the modeling accuracy of our proposed method was examined and benchmarked with multiple linear regression and non-linear least square fitting methods. Next, the relative importance among various key determinants toward organizational innovation can be computed using our method. We then compared the results with the qualitative judgment of field experts and professionals using the analytical hierarchy process. Based on the comparison outcomes, our proposed method is proved to be reasonably useful and practical in capturing the comparative influence among determinants toward organizational innovation."
175.0,Excluded,ec3,A new fuzzy network data envelopment analysis model for measuring the performance of agility in supply chains,Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a linear programming method for assessing the efficiency and productivity of organizational units called decision-making units (DMUs). We propose a new network DEA (NDEA) model for measuring the performance of agility in supply chains. The uncertainty of the input and output data is modeled with linguistic terms parameterized with fuzzy sets. The proposed fuzzy NDEA model is linear and independent of the α-cut variables. The linear feature allows for a quick identification of the global optimum solution and the α-cut independency feature allows for a significant reduction in the computational efforts. We show that our model always generate solutions within a bounded feasible region. Our model also eliminates the potential for conflict by producing unique interval efficiency scores for each DMU. The proposed model is used to measure the performance of agility in a real-life case study in the dairy industry.

177.0,Excluded,ec3,A novel \{DRM\} framework for peer-to-peer music content delivery,"Due to rapid advances in the network communications field in recent years, the distribution of large-scale music contents has become easier and more efficient than ever before. However, the unauthorized distribution of copyright-protected content has emerged as a major concern. Accordingly, this paper presents a content distribution framework with a \{DRM\} capability for \{P2P\} networks. The robustness of the content distribution is ensured by using a network coding approach based on the Lagrange polynomial interpolation method. When the downloading peer within the network receives sufficient coded pieces, it not only reconstructs the associated blocks using a finite field Gaussian elimination method, but also creates its own copies of the coded pieces within these blocks and shares these copies amongst the other peers in the network. As a result, the distribution overhead imposed on the music provider is substantially reduced and the number of coded pieces within the network is significantly increased, thereby overcoming the â€œlast piece problemâ€� inherent in existing \{P2P\} schemes. In the \{DRM\} module of the framework, the \{RSA\} public-key cryptosystem is used to generate a unique digital fingerprint for every user within the network. The fingerprint is embedded within the music file in a protected form such that the music provider can establish the identification of any user performing an unauthorized distribution of the file. The experimental results confirm that the proposed framework provides an efficient and secure means of distributing large-scale copyright-protected music contents with no discernible degradation in the audio quality."
178.0,Excluded,ec3,A novel framework for enterprise web services change management,"Business logic might be constantly improved or changed in order to provide enhanced services or to reduce cost. As a result, the software applications employed must be continuously updated to comply with the changes in their functional features. Changes in business logic of the web service must be done very quickly within the given time constraint as the services consumed by the providers and clients must not be affected. The framework proposed in this paper responds these challenges in three fold: Firstly, it formats the request and discovers required service logic through rule manager. Secondly, extracted logics are built as a complete web service and FSM is constructed by the Business Logic model to state the logic flow. Thirdly, it ascertains the right way for evaluation by analyzing dependency between the service logics through FSM. This allows enterprises to carve up and assimilate the services dynamically without developer's intervention at any stage. Thus this can be used for any IT enterprises in modern service industry to reduce the threshold of development and operation of services."

In recent years, Web-based applications have become more and more complicated and a lot of efforts have been placed on introducing new technologies such as J2EE, PhP, and.NET, etc., which have been universally accepted as the development technologies for Web-based applications. However, there is no universally accepted process model for the development of Web-based applications. Moreover, shaping the process model for small medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which have limited resources, has been relatively neglected. Based on our previous work, this paper presents an expanded lifecycle process model for the development of Web-based applications in SMEs. It consists of three sets of processes, i.e., requirement processes, development processes, and evolution processes. Particularly, the post-delivery evolution processes are important to SMEs to develop and maintain quality web applications with limited resources and time."

Two examples are used to demonstrate the application of process and techniques.The process is a carefully down-scaled version of a full and rich software engineering process particularly suited for novices learning object-oriented programming. In using it, we hope to achieve two things: to help novice programmers learn faster and better while at the same time laying the foundation for a more thorough treatment of the aspects of software engineering."
181.0,Excluded,ec3,A ontology-based process modelling for XP,"We describe the Extreme Programming Ontology (XPO), a formal model specifying the main concepts used in the extreme programming methodology and their properties. XPO's modular structure was developed using the usual normative top down approach to software engineering process modeling. It relies on a set of core components rooted in three main concepts: organisational role, product and phase. Besides being useful for indexing relevant documents and XP artifacts such as user stories and Wiki pages, XPO is aimed at being a sound basis for nonintrusive analysis of agile processes, mining process data about programmers activity and repositories content in order to extract new concepts potentially identifying critical factors in agile software development. Extension to XPO are also discussed, including other agile methodologies and more general software engineering concepts."
182.0,Excluded,ec3,A pair-programming experiment in a non-programming course,"Pair programming is a concept where two programmers work side by side at the same computer, writing code jointly. One of them, called the driver, is in control of the keyboard and mouse. The other, called the navigator, observes what the driver is doing and offers advice. It is the driver's job to write the code. The navigator has a chance to observe the larger picture, evaluating the driver's code for correctness of design and implementation. Studies have shown that pair programming is very effective. Two programmers can finish a task in little over half the elapsed time that a single programmer takes. And the quality of the code-measured in terms of absence of defects-is much higher.In the past few years, pair programming has made inroads into industry and into programming courses. However, it has not typically been used in courses that teach subjects other than programming or software engineering, nor has it been used in the analysis of experimental results. This paper reports on an experiment in a combined senior/masters-level computer architecture class, using Hennessy & Patterson's Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach as a text. Students were required to implement three projects simulating various aspects of a microarchitecture (cache, branch predictor, dynamic instruction scheduler). Then they engaged in an experimental analysis to find the best configuration in a design space. Students reported high levels of satisfaction with the experience of pair programming. Pair programmers obtained significantly higher grades on Project 1; however, differences on the other projects were not statistically significant."

184.0,Excluded,ec6,A Path for Exploring the Agile Organizing Framework in Technology Education,"When the Agile Organizing Framework (AOF) is examined through the lens of the social constructivist pedagogy, principles and practices that define an agile learning environment emerge. This paper presents a translation of the AOF to fit the context of instruction in higher education based on the social constructivist perspective, and is not limited to software engineering education. Additional research is needed to observe, test and validate each of the agile enablers and inhibitors in the classroom, and to determine which principles and practices best contribute to the achievement of learning objectives. Furthermore, we hypothesize that integrating elements of the agile learning environment into agile software development methodologies could enhance a team's ability to successfully synchronize exploitation (the continuous improvement of existing products and practices) with exploration (the identification and implementation of breakthrough innovations)."
185.0,Excluded,ec3,A pattern language for extensible program representation,"For the last 15 years, implementors of multiple view programming environments have sought a single code model that would form a suitable basis for all of the program analyses and tools that might be applied to the code. They have been unsuccessful. The consequences are a tendency to build monolithic, single-purpose tools, each of which implements its own specialized analyses and optimized representation. This restricts the availability of the analyses, and also limits the reusability of the representation by other tools. Unintegrated tools also produce inconsistent views, which reduce the value of multiple views.

This paper describes a set of architectural patterns that allow a single, minimal representation of program code to be extended as required to support new tools and program analyses, while still maintaining a simple and uniform interface to program properties. The patterns address efficiency, correctness and the integration of multiple analyses and tools in a modular fashion."

187.0,Excluded,ec7,A Pattern-Based Approach for Analysing Requirements in Socio-technical Systems Engineering,"Requirements analysis for socio-technical systems faces the challenge of multidisciplinary requirements that need to be collected from, understood by and agreed upon by various stakeholders. In some cases, requirements analysts or involved stakeholders do not fully understand the requirements that other disciplines impose, and thus fail to deliver a requirements specification that can be used in interdisciplinary development teams. In requirements engineering, requirement patterns are used to recognize important and recurring issues, thus reducing the effort of compiling a list of software requirements. The objective of the proposed dissertation project is to develop a similar pattern based approach that helps in analysing requirements from different disciplines and making them comprehensible for all stakeholders who need to agree to a requirement specification as the deliverable of requirements engineering. Due to the importance of legal aspects for, and users' trust in, socio-technical systems, requirement patterns will be developed for these two aspects. For the legal requirement patterns, legal requirements that are stable concerning changes due to their origin in fundamental, higher-ranked laws will be collected, and requirement patterns will be derived from them. For the requirement patterns for trust support, antecedents that build trust will be collected, and requirement patterns that demand functionality to support these antecedents will be developed. The obtained patterns are then used to compile a requirement list that serves as input for requirements negotiation with the various stakeholders."

189.0,Excluded,ec7,A personality based design approach using subgroup discovery,"To facilitate user-centered software engineering, developers need an easy to grasp understanding of the user. The use of personas helps to keep specific user needs in mind during the design process. Technology acceptance is of particular interest for the design of innovative applications previously unknown to potential users. Therefore, our research focuses on defining a typology of relevant user characteristics with respect to technology acceptance and transferring those findings to the description of personas. The presented work focuses on the statistical relationship between technology acceptance and personality. We apply sub-group discovery as a statistical tool. Based on the statistically derived subgroups and patterns we define the mentioned personas to help developers to understand different forms of technology acceptance. By integrating the specifically defined personas into existing methods in the field of software engineering the feasibility of the presented approach is demonstrated."
190.0,Excluded,ec3,"A Picture from the Model-Based Testing Area: Concepts, Techniques, and Challenges","Model-Based Testing (MBT) represents a feasible and interesting testing strategy where test cases are generated from formal models describing the software behavior/structure. The \{MBT\} field is continuously evolving, as it could be observed in the increasing number of \{MBT\} techniques published at the technical literature. However, there is still a gap between researches regarding \{MBT\} and its application in the software industry, mainly occasioned by the lack of information regarding the concepts, available techniques, and challenges in using this testing strategy in real software projects. This chapter presents information intended to support researchers and practitioners reducing this gap, consequently contributing to the transfer of this technology from the academia to the industry. It includes information regarding the concepts of MBT, characterization of 219 \{MBT\} available techniques, approaches supporting the selection of \{MBT\} techniques for software projects, risk factors that may influence the use of these techniques in the industry together with some mechanisms to mitigate their impact, and future perspectives regarding the \{MBT\} field."

However they are infrequently shown to clients, partly because developers believe that clients don't understand them. In this study we investigate the extent to which clients comprehend three types of diagram. Two popular UML diagrams (activity and use case) and Extreme X-Machines diagrams (a type of state diagram developed to support Extreme Programming) were shown to three clients for whom we had recently delivered the software that was represented. The clients were given some simple guidance on interpreting them and asked to evaluate how well they understood them. This pilot study found that all the diagrams studied seemed to be equally well understood, but further studies are required to evaluate their usefulness."

One of the problems related to their development is the lack of well-established development tools for this domain. As the p-health paradigm is focused on patient self-management, big challenges arise around the design and implementation of patient systems. This paper presents a reference platform created for the development of these applications, and shows the advantages of its adoption in a complex project dealing with cardio-vascular diseases."
193.0,Included,included,A plea for lean software process models,"Over the last 30 years we have tried very hard the rich process models approach, and we have not been extremely successful at it. Maybe we should try ""lean and mean"" software process models, rather than making them ""richer."" At minimum, we should try to analyze why the rich approaches have not worked; where they failed. Could it be that we were trying to solve the wrong problem? or that the real problems by far overshadow the process model issue? Or maybe the whole construction paradigm we use for software development is not suitable anymore? My position is that we should try the route of very simple software process models, to ensure a wider applicability, greater versatility, and acceptance. Possibly these new process models would be based on other paradigms of software or system development than the ""technical-rational"" construction idea. I would be wary of richer process models."

195.0,Excluded,ec3,A probabilistic alternative to regression suites,"Automated regression suites are essential in developing large applications, while maintaining reasonable quality and timetables. The main argument against the automation of regression suites, in addition to the cost of creation and maintenance, is the observation that if you run the same test many times, it becomes increasingly less likely to find bugs. To alleviate such problems, a new regression suite practice, using random test generators to create regression suites on-the-fly, is becoming more common. In this practice, instead of maintaining tests, we generate test suites on-the-fly by choosing several specifications and generating a number of tests from each specification. We describe techniques for optimizing random generated test suites. We first show how the set cover greedy algorithms, commonly used for selecting tests for regression suites, may be adapted to selecting specifications for randomly generated regression suites. We then introduce a new class of greedy algorithms, referred to as future-aware greedy algorithms. The algorithms are computationally efficient and generate more effective regression suites."
196.0,Excluded,ec7,A Probabilistic Framework for Goal-Oriented Risk Analysis,"Requirements completeness is among the most critical and difficult software engineering challenges. Missing requirements often result from poor risk analysis at requirements engineering time. Obstacle analysis is a goaloriented form of risk analysis aimed at anticipating exceptional conditions in which the software should behave adequately. In the identify-assess-control cycles of such analysis, the assessment step is not well supported by current techniques.This step is concerned with evaluating how likely the obstacles to goals are and how likely and severe their consequences are. Those key factors drive the selection of most appropriate countermeasures to be integrated in the system goal model for increased completeness. Moreover, obstacles to probabilistic goals are currently not supported; such goals prescribe that some corresponding target property should be satisfied in at least X% of the cases. The paper presents a probabilistic framework for goal specification and obstacle assessment. The specificat on language for goals and obstacles is extended with a probabilistic layer where probabilities have a precise semantics grounded on system-specific phenomena. The probability of a root obstacle to a goal is thereby computed by up-propagation of probabilities of finer-grained obstacles through the obstacle refinement tree. The probability and severity of obstacle consequences is in turn computed by up-propagation from the obstructed leaf goals through the goal refinement graph. The paper shows how the computed information can be used to prioritize obstacles for countermeasure selection towards a more complete and robust goal model. The framework is evaluated on a non-trivial carpooling support system."

There is not any reference model related to the processes or practices to manage a living lab. This article presents a reference model to manage effectively the synergies of software companies with the other stakeholders participating in a living lab. The article describes the approach used to create the reference model through the analysis of a multiple case study considering six living labs and discusses the lessons learned during the creation of the process reference model.
198.0,Excluded,ec7,A product management challenge: Creating software product value through requirements selection,"It is important for a software company to maximize value creation for a given investment. The purpose of requirements engineering activities is to add business value that is accounted for in terms of return on investment of a software product. This paper provides insight into the release planning processes used in the software industry to create software product value, by presenting three case studies. It examines how \{IT\} professionals perceive value creation through requirements engineering and how the release planning process is conducted to create software product value. It also presents to what degree the major stakeholdersâ€™ perspectives are represented in the decision-making process. Our findings show that the client and market base of the software product represents the most influential group in the decision to implement specific requirements. This is reflected both in terms of deciding the processes followed and the decision-making criteria applied when selecting requirements for the product. Furthermore, the management of software product value is dependant on the context in which the product exists. Factors, such as the maturity of the product, the marketplace in which it exists, and the development tools and methods available, influence the criteria that decide whether a requirement is included in a specific project or release."

The result was a huge success. In just three months, an R&amp;D department consisting of 200 employees and 30 teams transitioned from a traditional waterfall-style approach to ADM. Less than sixteen months later, the company had realized a 37% increase in productivity.The rapid transition of ADM precipitated massive changes in how product managers work, interact with members of others departments, and manage dependencies between teams. This report details some of the challenges they faced, how they handled them, and how ADM has helped Product Managers become more effective."

To address this shortcoming, this paper reviews literature on alternative \{PM\} approaches, in the context of project contingency theory. Firstly, the paper identifies five selection factors seen within this literature: uncertainty, complexity, urgency, team empowerment and criticality. Secondly, the paper adapts project contingency theory to encompass these factors. Thirdly, these factors are used to develop a contingency framework based on project uncertainty and its consequences. Finally, the paper discusses the practical applications of the framework, such as its use for project process selection, tuning of processes, and project risk assessment."

These firms are facing the same software engineering challenges that affect large software firms. Software Process Improvement (SPI) traditional models were developed to help large and very large firms, however small software firms could not afford these models. Furthermore, they need to manage and improve their software development processes for several reasons such as dealing with the rapid technology advances, maintaining their products, satisfying the customersâ€™ needs and sustaining their operations. This paper presents the methodologyâ€™s stages of developing a suitable software development process improvement framework by using Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI-DEV V1.2) as the basic model for improvement and Extreme Programming (XP) method as the basic software development method."

It describes a centralized infrastructure-based cognitive radio network, where dynamic \{TVWS\} allocation among unlicensed systems is administrated by a spectrum broker, carrying out radio-resource management and spectrum trading in real time. For efficient system performance as a matter of both maximum-possible radio resource exploitation and trading revenue, the paper discusses the design and implementation of a prototype mechanism at the spectrum broker side, which exploits the backtracking algorithm for obtaining the best-matching solution. Performance evaluation experiments carried-out under controlled conditions (i.e. simulation) verified the validity of the proposed architecture, besides establishing its capacity for maximum spectrum utilization and minimum fragmentation under a fixed-price trading policy."
203.0,Excluded,ec3,A qualitative study of the determinants of self-managing team effectiveness in a scrum team,"There are many evidences in the literature that the use self-managing teams has positive impacts on several dimensions of team effectiveness. Agile methods, supported by the Agile Manifesto, defend the use of self-managing teams in software development in substitution of hierarchically managed, traditional teams. The goal of this research was to study how a self-managing software team works in practice and how the behaviors of the software organization support or hinder the effectiveness of such teams. We performed a single case holistic case study, looking in depth into the actual behavior of a mature Scrum team in industry. Using interviews and participant observation, we collected qualitative data from five team members in several interactions. We extract the behavior of the team and of the software company in terms of the determinants of self-managing team effectiveness defined in a theoretical model from the literature. We found evidence that 17 out of 24 determinants of this model exist in the studied context. We concluded that certain determinants can support or facilitate the adoption of methodologies like Scrum, while the use of Scrum may affect other determinants."
204.0,Excluded,ec7,A quality model for design documentation in model-centric projects,"Model-centric software processes, such as RUP, involve a rich set of artefacts (e.g., requirements specifications, design models, code) used for many activities (e.g., cost estimation, construction, communication, maintenance, archiving) by engineers in many roles (e.g., analysts, designers, developers, testers, managers). This diversity makes organisation and implementation of infrastructure for artefacts (such as document repositories, web portals, editors, indexes) a challenge: without analysis of involved tasks, and validation of the infrastructure's implementation, some tasks may not be properly supported. This paper presents a quality model for design documentation (i.e., for artefacts on the abstraction level between requirements specifications and code) intended to be used for requirements engineering of such. Twenty two qualities, most of which concern nonfunctional requirements on the design documentation are identified. The model is based on qualitative analysis of interviews with engineers and managers in a large software development organisation with 8 years experience of implementing RUP."
205.0,Excluded,ec3,A replicated quasi-experimental study on the influence of personality and team climate in software development,"This article reports a replication of a quasi-experimental study analyzing how personality factors and team climate influence software development team effectiveness, product quality and team member satisfaction. The replication was designed on the basis of the original quasi-experimental study, both of which were run in an academic setting. In the original study, data were collected from a sample of 35 three-member developer teams. All these teams used an adaptation of extreme programming (XP) to the academic environment to develop the same software system. In the replication, the data were collected from a sample of 34 three- or four-member developer teams working on the same software project. Student teams used a common object-oriented software development paradigm to solve the set problem and applied the Unified Process. In both studies all teams were formed at random, and their members were blind to the quasi-experimental conditions and hypotheses. The replication of this empirical study aims to verify the results of the original quasi-experiment. It examines, first, whether personality factors (neuroticism, extroversion, agreeableness, openness to experience and conscientiousness) are related to the quality of the developed software and team member satisfaction and, second, whether the preferences, perceptions and preferences-perceptions fit for the four team climate factors (participative safety, support for innovation, team vision and task orientation) are related to the quality of the developed software and team member satisfaction. The results of the replication corroborate some of the findings of the original study. On the one hand, the results revealed that there is a significant correlation between the extroversion personality factor and software quality, but no significant correlation between the extroversion personality factor and team satisfaction. Also, we found that the perception of team climate where participative safety is high is related to better quality software. We observed significant relationships between the perception of the four team climate factors and team member satisfaction. Additionally, the results showed a positive relationship between software quality and teams in which the real climate perception at the end of the project is better than preferences stated by team members at the outset of the project for the participative safety factor. Finally, we found that teams where the real climate is better than the stated preferences for the team orientation factor exhibit a direct and positive relationship to team member satisfaction."
206.0,Excluded,ec3,A replicated survey of software testing practices in the Canadian province of Alberta: What has changed from 2004 to 2009?,"Software organizations have typically de-emphasized the importance of software testing. In an earlier study in 2004, our colleagues reported the results of an Alberta-wide regional survey of software testing techniques in practice. Five years after that first study, the authors felt it is time to replicate the survey and analyze what has changed and what not from 2004 to 2009. This study was conducted during the summer of 2009 by surveying software organizations in the Canadian province of Alberta. The survey results reveal important and interesting findings about software testing practices in Alberta, and point out what has changed from 2004 to 2009 and what not. Note that although our study is conducted in the province of Alberta, we have compared the results to few international similar studies, such as the ones conducted in the US, Turkey, Hong Kong and Australia, The study should thus be of interest to all testing professionals world-wide. Among the findings are the followings: (1) almost all companies perform unit and system testing with a slight increase since 2004, (2) automation of unit, integration and systems tests has increased sharply since 2004, (3) more organization are using observations and expert opinion to conduct usability testing, (4) the choices of test-case generation mechanisms have not changed much from 2004, (5) \{JUnit\} and \{IBM\} Rational tools are the most widely used test tools, (6) Alberta companies still face approximately the same defect-related economic issues as do companies in other jurisdictions, (7) Alberta software firms have improved their test automation capability since 2004, but there is still some room for improvement, and (8) compared to 2004, more companies are spending more effort on pre-release testing."
207.0,Included,included,A report on the XP workshop on agile product line engineering,"Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) promises to lower the costs of developing individual applications as they heavily reuse existing artifacts. Besides decreasing costs, software reuse achieves faster development and higher quality. Traditionally, SPLE favors big design upfront and employs traditional, heavy weight processes. On the other hand, agile methods have been proposed to rapidly develop high quality software by focusing on producing working code while reducing upfront analysis and design. Combining both paradigms, although is challenging, can yield significant improvements. In this workshop, we discussed the challenges, the research questions and the tradeoffs that need to be addressed for such an integration to enjoy success."

212.0,Excluded,ec7,A rigorous approach to orchestrating grid services,"Although conceived for web services, it is shown how Bpel (Business Process Execution Language) can be used to orchestrate a collection of grid services. This is achieved using the technique of Cress (Communication Representation Employing Systematic Specification) to describe the composition of grid services. Cress descriptions are automatically translated into Lotos (Language Of Temporal Ordering Specification), allowing systematic checks for interoperability and logical errors prior to implementation. Mustard (Multiple-Use Scenario Test and Refusal Description) is used to validate the generated specification against use case scenarios. The same Cress descriptions are then automatically converted into Bpel/Wsdl code for practical realisation of the composed services. Grid services are executed by Globus Toolkit 4, while their orchestration is supported by the ActiveBpel engine. The Mustard scenarios are used again to evaluate the implementation. The overall approach therefore supports rigorous development and automated creation of orchestrated grid services."

It is suitable for small teams, lightweight projects and vague/volatile requirements. However, some challenges are left to developers when they desire to practise XP. A critical one of them is constructing the release plan and negotiating it with customers. In this paper, we propose a risk-driven method for XP release planning. It has been applied in a case study and the results show the method is feasible and effective. XP practicers can follow it to decide a suitable release plan and control the development process."

Throughout these years, \{SBES\} has gathered a large body of studies in software testing. Aimed at providing an insightful understanding of what has already been published in such event, we have synthesized its 25-year history of research on software testing. Using information drawn from this overview we highlighted which software testing topics have been the most extensively surveyed in \{SBES\} literature.

Although these two approaches are often considered antagonist, the use of an agile approach to reach certain CMMI maturity levels may result beneficial to organizations that develop Web systems, since they would take the advantages of both approaches. In Web community, this union may be very interesting, because agile approaches fits with the special needs of Web development, and they could be a useful tool for companies getting a certain grade of maturity. This work analyzes the goals of CMMI maturity level 2 and the feasibility of achieving them using the practices proposed by Scrum, trying to assess whether the use of this methodology is suitable for meeting the CMMI generic and specific goals or not. Finally, and based on this analysis, this paper raises a possible extension of Scrum, based on agile techniques, to accommodate the CMMI maturity level 2."
218.0,Excluded,ec3,A secure collaboration service for dynamic virtual organizations,"Nowadays, various promising paradigms of distributed computing over the Internet, such as Grids, \{P2P\} and Clouds, have emerged for resource sharing and collaboration. To enable resources sharing and collaboration across different domains in an open computing environment, virtual organizations (VOs) often need to be established dynamically. However, the dynamic and autonomous characteristics of participating domains pose great challenges to the security of virtual organizations. In this paper, we propose a secure collaboration service, called PEACE-VO, for dynamic virtual organizations management. The federation approach based on role mapping has extensively been used to build virtual organizations over multiple domains. However, there is a serious issue of potential policy conflicts with this approach, which brings a security threat to the participating domains. To address this issue, we first depict concepts of implicit conflicts and explicit conflicts that may exist in virtual organization collaboration policies. Then, we propose a fully distributed algorithm to detect potential policy conflicts. With this algorithm participating domains do not have to disclose their full local privacy policies, and is able to withhold malicious internal attacks. Finally, we present the system architecture of PEACE-VO and design two protocols for \{VO\} management and authorization. PEACE-VO services and protocols have successfully been implemented in the \{CROWN\} test bed. Comprehensive experimental study demonstrates that our approach is scalable and efficient."

The development of Service Oriented Business Intelligence (SOBI) architecture based on an analysis of existing architectures/models and customer requirements that were captured through questionnaires. The architecture integrates integrate data from heterogeneous data sources of the organization. A \{SOBI\} prototype system that simulates the basic operation of a typical Telecoms organization has been developed and evaluated.
221.0,Excluded,ec3,A social network approach to resolving group-level conflict in context-aware services,"Group conflict that occurs when delivering context-aware services negatively affects service usage within a specific service space, and researchers have proposed few conflict resolution methods to address the issue. This paper presents a methodology to autonomously resolve the conflict arising between users in identical contexts, such as place and computing resources. To do so, a two-phase case-based reasoning method is proposed. To minimize privacy concerns, a social network model is applied to produce key social context data, secondary to personal data, and which is used in place of the usersâ€™ personal data for case-based reasoning. To show the feasibility of the idea proposed in this paper, a prototype system with simulation-based validation is tested to determine conflict resolution strategies and a simulation test has been performed."

223.0,Included,included,A software methodology for applied research: eXtreme Researching,"Applied research is, by necessity, a distributed, collaborative process. To be useful, research methodologies must not only be applicable in such an environment, but must also be adaptive to the needs of human resources and specific research area requirements. This paper introduces eXtreme Researching (XR), an adaptation of eXtreme Programming (XP) by Ericsson, to support distributed telecommunications research and development. XR builds on XP and tailors it to meet the needs of applied industrial research. It adopts and extends the most useful elements of XP: collective ownership, planning game, continuous integration and metaphor and shows how they are applicable in multi-site, research projects. XPWeb is developed as a tool to facilitate XR in a distributed research environment. XPWeb and XR are actively used by Ericsson Applied Research and have been shown to significantly increase output and efficiencies in multi disciplinary research projects.

224.0,Excluded,ec3,A software oriented CNC system based on Linux/RTLinux,"The software-oriented CNC is one of the ideal solutions for open architecture CNC. However, its implementation is a difficult task, especially the guarantee of system’s real-time performance. In this paper, a software oriented CNC system named Lin-soft CNC, whose operating system (OS) is Linux with its real-time extension - RTLinux - was proposed and depicted. The proposed system consists of four layers: the GUI, non-real-time layer, real-time layer and driver layer. Both the system and subsystem layout are detailed, along with the relevant implementation detail, such as the hierarchy design and the data communication between layers. Furthermore, the real-time layer has been identified as the kernel of the system, in which a simple and effective strategy - rational design of data buffer and high precision period of the real-time thread - is adopted to guarantee the real-time performance. At last, the prototype controller and test results are present."
225.0,Included,included,A Starting Point for Negotiations—Delivering with a Heterogeneous Team," This paper presents a counterintuitive Pre-Sprint Work Balancing methodology that has substantially increased the ability of our highly heterogeneous Scrum [1] team to deliver what it promises at the end of each sprint. The process essentially consists of preplanning steps that acknowledge both the heterogeneity in developer's time and skill level, as well as Product Owner priorities. These preplanning activities act as a starting point for negotiations with the team during the Sprint Planning Meeting. For our team, delivery of all promised tasks in a sprint has increased from less than 1/3 of our sprints to more than 2/3, with indications that we are heading towards nearly 100% delivery."
226.0,Excluded,ec3,A Story about a Dinosaur Called Mainframe and a Small Fly Agile,"Once, long time ago, there was a very old dinosaur living on the planet Earth. Big yet invisible to most, living in the dark places full of cold, dust and cables; surrounded by several groups of faithful - very specialized software teams, the only ones who truly understood him. But the life on the planet Earth had never been steady and recently spinning faster and faster around, so it happen that even this group had to be changed and follow the fast changing business environment outside, unless they all die. And here our story begins. The story is based on our experiences from multiple companies and projects operating on high-performing applications environment - mainframes. The companies are mainly from banking services, insurance systems and other very specific software industry areas where mainframes are still very popular."
227.0,Excluded,ec6,A story-telling approach for a software engineering course design,"Advanced programming and software engineering techniques are challenging to learn due to their inherent complexity. However, to the average student they are even more challenging because they have never experienced the context in which the techniques are appropriate. For instance, why learn design patterns to increase maintainability when student exercises are never maintained? In this paper, we outline the contextual problems that software engineering teaching has to deal with and present a story telling approach for course design as a remedy. We outline the stories that over the last five years have structured lecturing and mandatory exercises for our advanced programming/software engineering course, and present benefits, liabilities, and experiences with the approach comparing it to the normal, topic structured, course design."
228.0,Excluded,ec3,A structured experiment of test-driven development,"Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development practice in which unit test cases are incrementally written prior to code implementation. We ran a set of structured experiments with 24 professional pair programmers. One group developed a small Java program using \{TDD\} while the other (control group), used a waterfall-like approach. Experimental results, subject to external validity concerns, tend to indicate that \{TDD\} programmers produce higher quality code because they passed 18% more functional black-box test cases. However, the \{TDD\} programmers took 16% more time. Statistical analysis of the results showed that a moderate statistical correlation existed between time spent and the resulting quality. Lastly, the programmers in the control group often did not write the required automated test cases after completing their code. Hence it could be perceived that waterfall-like approaches do not encourage adequate testing. This intuitive observation supports the perception that \{TDD\} has the potential for increasing the level of unit testing in the software industry."
229.0,Excluded,ec3,A study of enabling factors for rapid fielding: combined practices to balance speed and stability,"Agile projects are showing greater promise in rapid fielding as compared to waterfall projects. However, there is a lack of clarity regarding what really constitutes and contributes to success. We interviewed project teams with incremental development lifecycles, from five government and commercial organizations, to gain a better understanding of success and failure factors for rapid fielding on their projects. A key area we explored involves how Agile projects deal with the pressure to rapidly deliver high-value capability, while maintaining project speed (delivering functionality to the users quickly) and product stability (providing reliable and flexible product architecture). For example, due to schedule pressure we often see a pattern of high initial velocity for weeks or months, followed by a slowing of velocity due to stability issues. Business stakeholders find this to be disruptive as the rate of capability delivery slows while the team addresses stability problems. We found that experienced practitioners, when faced with these challenges, do not apply Agile practices alone. Instead they combine practicesAgile, architecture, or otherin creative ways to respond quickly to unanticipated stability problems. In this paper, we summarize the practices practitioners we interviewed from Agile projects found most valuable and provide an overarching scenario that provides insight into how and why these practices emerge."
230.0,Excluded,ec3,A study of optimal allocation of computing resources in cloud manufacturing systems,"As a new advanced service-oriented networked manufacturing model, cloud manufacturing (CMfg) has been proposed recently. The optimal allocation of computing resources (OACR) is a core part for implementing CMfg. High heterogeneity, high dynamism, and virtualization make the OACR problem more complex than the traditional scheduling problems in grid system or cloud computing system. In this paper, a new comprehensive model for OACR is proposed in the CMfg system. In this model, all main computation, communication, and reliability constraints in the special circumstances are considered. To solve the OACR problem, a new improved niche immune algorithm was presented. Associated with the niche strategy, new heuristics are designed flexibly based on the characteristics of the problem and pheromone is added for adaptive searching. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed heuristic information and show NIA’s high performances for addressing the OACR problem compared with other intelligent algorithms."
231.0,Included,included,A study of the documentation essential to software maintenance,"Software engineering has been striving for years to improve the practice of software development and maintenance. Documentation has long been prominent on the list of recommended practices to improve development and help maintenance. Recently however, agile methods started to shake this view, arguing that the goal of the game is to produce software and that documentation is only useful as long as it helps to reach this goal.On the other hand, in the re-engineering field, people wish they could re-document useful legacy software so that they may continue maintain them or migrate them to new platform.In these two case, a crucial question arises: ""How much documentation is enough?"" In this article, we present the results of a survey of software maintainers to try to establish what documentation artifacts are the most useful to them."
232.0,Excluded,ec3,A study on agility and testing processes in software organizations,"In this paper, we studied the differences in testing activities between software organizations which apply agile development methods and organizations which take the traditional plan-driven approach. Our focus was on the concepts which allow the software organization to successfully apply agile development methods or plan-driven methods. We also observed the test process enhancements and hindrances, which originate in the selected development method. We interviewed 12 organizations, which were selected to represent different polar types of software production. The interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed for further analysis. The study yielded hypotheses which were derived by applying the qualitative grounded theory method. The results indicated that in practice, agile methods can improve the position of testing through the early involvement of testing activities in development, and also have a positive influence on end-product satisfaction. By applying these results, organizations can improve their processes and avoid pitfalls when transitioning to agile methods."
233.0,Excluded,ec3,A study on PDAs for onboard applications and technologies and methodologies,"In 2005, the European Space Agency carried out a study intended to clarify the use of PDAs for onboard space operations. Being this a rather new application domain due to the introduction of uncommon technology onboard, a need for feasibility clarification was perceived. The study narrowed its unbounded technological dimension by focusing on Java technologies. Furthermore, at a software engineering level an “agile” approach was chosen for evaluation because of the high degree of user interaction and their ability to cope with general requirement changes like those resulting from the uncertainty about the actual features and quality of specific PDA platforms and COTS. Two studies were performed in parallel with the same objectives but obtaining different solutions. Suitable “agile-like” approaches compatible with space software standards were defined and tried. A space crew representative was involved from the early phases of the studies, and a final evaluation exercise at the European Astronaut Centre training facilities was performed. Feedback on the suitability of the technologies and the MMI design choices were obtained together with other unexpected lessons. The paper is concluded with an enumeration of lessons learnt and hypotheses about “agile” approaches of interest for the software engineering community."
235.0,Excluded,ec3,A study to support agile methods more effectively through traceability,"Traceability is recognized to be important for supporting agile development processes. However, after analyzing many of the existing traceability approaches it can be concluded that they strongly depend on traditional development process characteristics. Within this paper it is justified that this is a drawback to support adequately agile processes. As it is discussed, some concepts do not have the same semantics for traditional and agile methodologies. This paper proposes three features that traceability models should support to be less dependent on a specific development process: (1) user-definable traceability links, (2) roles, and (3) linkage rules. To present how these features can be applied, an emerging traceability metamodel (TmM) will be used within this paper. TmM supports the definition of traceability methodologies adapted to the needs of each project. As it is shown, after introducing these three features into traceability models, two main advantages are obtained: 1) the support they can provide to agile process stakeholders is significantly more extensive, and 2) it will be possible to achieve a higher degree of automation. In this sense it will be feasible to have a methodical trace acquisition and maintenance process adapted to agile processes."
236.0,Excluded,ec3,A successful application of a Test-Driven Development strategy in the industrial environment,"Unit Test-Driven Development (UTDD) and Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD) are software development techniques to incrementally develop software where the test cases, unit or acceptance tests respectively, are specified before the functional code. There are little empirical evidences supporting or refuting the utility of these techniques in an industrial context. Just a few case studies can be found in literature within the industrial environment and they show conflicting results (positive, negative and neutral). In this report, we present a successful application of UTDD in combination with ATDD in a commercial project. By successful we mean that the project goals are reached without an extra economic cost. All the UTDD and ATDD implementations are based on the same basic concepts, but they may differ in specific adaptations to each project or team. In the implementation presented here, the business requirements are specified by means of executable acceptance tests, which then are the input of a development process where the functional code is written in response to specific unit tests. Our goal is to share our successful experience in a specific project from an empirical point of view. We highlight the advantages and disadvantages of adopting UTDD and ATDD and identify some conditions that facilitate success. The main conclusions we draw from this project are that ATDD contributes to clearly capture and validate the business requirements, but it requires an extensive cooperation from the customer; and that UTDD has not a significant impact neither on productivity nor on software quality. These results cannot be generalized, but they point out that under some circumstances a test-driven development strategy can be a possible option to take into account by software professionals."
237.0,Excluded,ec3,A survey of software project managers on software process change,"Software project managers play an important role in selecting their software development process. In this study we conducted a survey of software project managers about software process change. The result of the survey revealed several factors affecting this type of decision making. It also revealed critical issues in software development projects. In particular, the findings point to the importance of a piloting strategy in technology transfer, as well as the importance of highlighting cost, quality, and schedule information in reporting evidence of a new technique's effectiveness. We expect that the findings of this study could facilitate research on technology transfer and adoption."
238.0,Excluded,ec3,A survey of software testing practices in Canada,"Software testing is an important activity in the software development life-cycle. In an earlier study in 2009, we reported the results of a regional survey of software testing practices among practitioners in the Canadian province of Alberta. To get a larger nationwide view on this topic (across Canada), we conducted a newer survey with a revised list of questions in 2010. Compared to our previous Alberta-wide survey (53 software practitioners), the nation-wide survey had larger number of participants (246 practitioners). We report the survey design, execution and results in this article. The survey results reveal important and interesting findings about software testing practices in Canada. Whenever possible, we also compare the results of this survey to other similar studies, such as the ones conducted in the US, Sweden and Australia, and also two previous Alberta-wide surveys, including our 2009 survey. The results of our survey will be of interest to testing professionals both in Canada and world-wide. It will also benefit researchers in observing the latest trends in software testing industry identifying the areas of strength and weakness, which would then hopefully encourage further industry-academia collaborations in this area. Among the findings are the followings: (1) the importance of testing-related training is increasing, (2) functional and unit testing are two common test types that receive the most attention and efforts spent on them, (3) usage of the mutation testing approach is getting attention among Canadian firms, (4) traditional Test-last Development (TLD) style is still dominating and a few companies are attempting the new development approaches such as Test-Driven Development (TDD), and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD), (5) in terms of the most popular test tools, \{NUnit\} and Web application testing tools overtook \{JUnit\} and \{IBM\} Rational tools, (6) most Canadian companies use a combination of two coverage metrics: decision (branch) and condition coverage, (7) number of passing user acceptance tests and number of defects found per day (week or month) are regarded as the most important quality assurance metrics and decision factors to release, (8) in most Canadian companies, testers are out-numbered by developers, with ratios ranging from 1:2 to 1:5, (9) the majority of Canadian firms spent less than 40% of their efforts (budget and time) on testing during development, and (10) more than 70% of respondents participated in online discussion forums related to testing on a regular basis."
239.0,Excluded,ec3,A survey study of critical success factors in agile software projects,"While software is so important for all facets of the modern world, software development itself is not a perfect process. Agile software engineering methods have recently emerged as a new and different way of developing software as compared to the traditional methodologies. However, their success has mostly been anecdotal, and research in this subject is still scant in the academic circles. This research study was a survey study on the critical success factors of Agile software development projects using quantitative approach. Based on existing literature, a preliminary list of potential critical success factors of Agile projects were identified and compiled. Subsequently, reliability analysis and factor analysis were conducted to consolidate this preliminary list into a final set of 12 possible critical success factors for each of the four project success categories â€“ Quality, Scope, Time, and Cost. A survey was conducted among Agile professionals, gathering survey data from 109 Agile projects from 25 countries across the world. Multiple regression techniques were used, both at the full regression model and at the optimized regression model via the stepwise screening procedure. The results revealed that only 10 out of 48 hypotheses were supported, identifying three critical success factors for Agile software development projects: (a) Delivery Strategy, (b) Agile Software Engineering Techniques, and (c) Team Capability. Limitations of the study are discussed together with interpretations for practitioners. To ensure success of their projects, managers are urged to focus on choosing a high-caliber team, practicing Agile engineering techniques and following Agile-style delivery strategy."
240.0,Excluded,ec3,A survey study of critical success factors in agile software projects in former Yugoslavia \{IT\} companies,"Determining the factors that have an influence on the success of the software development projects has been the focus of extensive research for more than 30 years. In recent years agile methodology of software development has become the dominant one for all kinds of software development projects. In this paper we present the results of empirical study for determining critical factors that influence the success of agile software projects which we conducted among senior developers and project managers from \{IT\} companies located in the former Yugoslavia countries within South Eastern Europe (SEE) region. This study is inspired by the similar study conducted 5 years ago (Chow and Cao, 2008). With this study we were not able to confirm the model developed in the previous study. Moreover it disconfirmed not only part of the factors, but very much questioned the whole scheme. However, we were able to shed additional light regarding agile software development in former Yugoslavia countries from \{SEE\} region as a reference region for investigating outsourced projects done in agile way."
241.0,Excluded,ec3,A systematic mapping study of web application testing,"AbstractContext The Web has had a significant impact on all aspects of our society. As our society relies more and more on the Web, the dependability of web applications has become increasingly important. To make these applications more dependable, for the past decade researchers have proposed various techniques for testing web-based software applications. Our literature search for related studies retrieved 147 papers in the area of web application testing, which have appeared between 2000 and 2011. Objective As this research area matures and the number of related papers increases, it is important to systematically identify, analyze, and classify the publications and provide an overview of the trends in this specialized field. Method We review and structure the body of knowledge related to web application testing through a systematic mapping (SM) study. As part of this study, we pose two sets of research questions, define selection and exclusion criteria, and systematically develop and refine a classification schema. In addition, we conduct a bibliometrics analysis of the papers included in our study. Results Our study includes a set of 79 papers (from the 147 retrieved papers) published in the area of web application testing between 2000 and 2011. We present the results of our systematic mapping study. Our mapping data is available through a publicly-accessible repository. We derive the observed trends, for instance, in terms of types of papers, sources of information to derive test cases, and types of evaluations used in papers. We also report the demographics and bibliometrics trends in this domain, including top-cited papers, active countries and researchers, and top venues in this research area. Conclusion We discuss the emerging trends in web application testing, and discuss the implications for researchers and practitioners in this area. The results of our systematic mapping can help researchers to obtain an overview of existing web application testing approaches and indentify areas in the field that require more attention from the research community."
242.0,Excluded,ec7,A systematic mapping study on software product line evolution: From legacy system reengineering to product line refactoring,"Software product lines (SPLs) are used in industry to develop families of similar software systems. Legacy systems, either highly configurable or with a story of versions and local variations, are potential candidates for reconfiguration as \{SPLs\} using reengineering techniques. Existing \{SPLs\} can also be restructured using specific refactorings to improve their internal quality. Although many contributions (including industrial experiences) can be found in the literature, we lack a global vision covering the whole life cycle of an evolving product line. This study aims to survey existing research on the reengineering of legacy systems into \{SPLs\} and the refactoring of existing \{SPLs\} in order to identify proven approaches and pending challenges for future research in both subfields. We launched a systematic mapping study to find as much literature as possible, covering the diverse terms involved in the search string (restructuring, refactoring, reengineering, etc. always connected with SPLs) and filtering the papers using relevance criteria. The 74 papers selected were classified with respect to several dimensions: main focus, research and contribution type, academic or industrial validation if included, etc. We classified the research approaches and analyzed their feasibility for use in industry. The results of the study indicate that the initial works focused on the adaptation of generic reengineering processes to \{SPL\} extraction. Starting from that foundation, several trends have been detected in recent research: the integrated or guided reengineering of (typically object-oriented) legacy code and requirements; specific aspect-oriented or feature-oriented refactoring into SPLs, and more recently, refactoring for the evolution of existing product lines. A majority of papers include academic or industrial case studies, though only a few are based on quantitative data. The degree of maturity of both subfields is different: Industry examples for the reengineering of the legacy system subfield are abundant, although more evaluation research is needed to provide better evidence for adoption in industry. Product line evolution through refactoring is an emerging topic with some pending challenges. Although it has recently received some attention, the theoretical foundation is rather limited in this subfield and should be addressed in the near future. To sum up, the main contributions of this work are the classification of research approaches as well as the analysis of remaining challenges, open issues, and research opportunities."
243.0,Excluded,ec3,A systematic mapping study on the combination of static and dynamic quality assurance techniques,"Context A lot of different quality assurance techniques exist to ensure high quality products. However, most often they are applied in isolation. A systematic combination of different static and dynamic quality assurance techniques promises to exploit synergy effects, such as higher defect detection rates or reduced quality assurance costs. However, a systematic overview of such combinations and reported evidence about achieving synergy effects with such kinds of combinations is missing. Objective The main goal of this article is the classification and thematic analysis of existing approaches that combine different static and dynamic quality assurance technique, including reported effects, characteristics, and constraints. The result is an overview of existing approaches and a suitable basis for identifying future research directions. Method A systematic mapping study was performed by two researchers, focusing on four databases with an initial result set of 2498 articles, covering articles published between 1985 and 2010. Results In total, 51 articles were selected and classified according to multiple criteria. The two main dimensions of a combination are integration (i.e., the output of one quality assurance technique is used for the second one) and compilation (i.e., different quality assurance techniques are applied to ensure a common goal, but in isolation). The combination of static and dynamic analyses is one of the most common approaches and usually conducted in an integrated manner. With respect to the combination of inspection and testing techniques, this is done more often in a compiled way than in an integrated way. Conclusion The results show an increased interest in this topic in recent years, especially with respect to the integration of static and dynamic analyses. Inspection and testing techniques are currently mostly performed in an isolated manner. The integration of inspection and testing techniques is a promising research direction for the exploitation of additional synergy effects."
244.0,Excluded,ec3,A systematic review of comparative evidence of aspect-oriented programming,"Context Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) promises to improve many facets of software quality by providing better modularization and separation of concerns, which may have system wide affect. There have been numerous claims in favor and against \{AOP\} compared with traditional programming languages such as Objective Oriented and Structured Programming Languages. However, there has been no attempt to systematically review and report the available evidence in the literature to support the claims made in favor or against \{AOP\} compared with non-AOP approaches. Objective This research aimed to systematically identify, analyze, and report the evidence published in the literature to support the claims made in favor or against \{AOP\} compared with non-AOP approaches. Method We performed a systematic literature review of empirical studies of \{AOP\} based development, published in major software engineering journals and conference proceedings. Results Our search strategy identified 3307 papers, of which 22 were identified as reporting empirical studies comparing \{AOP\} with non-AOP approaches. Based on the analysis of the data extracted from those 22 papers, our findings show that for performance, code size, modularity, and evolution related characteristics, a majority of the studies reported positive effects, a few studies reported insignificant effects, and no study reported negative effects; however, for cognition and language mechanism, negative effects were reported. Conclusion \{AOP\} is likely to have positive effect on performance, code size, modularity, and evolution. However its effect on cognition and language mechanism is less likely to be positive. Care should be taken using \{AOP\} outside the context in which it has been validated."
245.0,Excluded,ec7,A systematic review of security requirements engineering,"One of the most important aspects in the achievement of secure software systems in the software development process is what is known as Security Requirements Engineering. However, very few reviews focus on this theme in a systematic, thorough and unbiased manner, that is, none of them perform a systematic review of security requirements engineering, and there is not, therefore, a sufficiently good context in which to operate. In this paper we carry out a systematic review of the existing literature concerning security requirements engineering in order to summarize the evidence regarding this issue and to provide a framework/background in which to appropriately position new research activities."
246.0,Excluded,ec3,A systematic review of software process tailoring,"Although software process proposals appear continuously, it is difficult to fit any of them into a given company as they are. Thus, some kind of adaptation or tailoring is always necessary. The goal of software process tailoring is to adapt an ""off-the-shelf"" software process to meet the needs of a specific organization or project. Although process tailoring is a mandatory activity in most software process proposals, it is usually carried out by following an ad-hoc approach, and the amount of research done on this topic to date can be considered small. This paper presents a systematic review of software process tailoring, analyzing the existing approaches towards this activity, discussing the main issues related to the problem, and providing an up-to-date and complete framework in which to position new research activities."
247.0,Excluded,ec3,A systematic review of software robustness,"Context With the increased use of software for running key functions in modern society it is of utmost importance to understand software robustness and how to support it. Although there have been many contributions to the field there is a lack of a coherent and summary view. Objective To address this issue, we have conducted a literature review in the field of robustness. Method This review has been conducted by following guidelines for systematic literature reviews. Systematic reviews are used to find and classify all existing and available literature in a certain field. Results From 9193 initial papers found in three well-known research databases, the 144 relevant papers were extracted through a multi-step filtering process with independent validation in each step. These papers were then further analyzed and categorized based on their development phase, domain, research, contribution and evaluation type. The results indicate that most existing results on software robustness focus on verification and validation of Commercial of the shelf (COTS) or operating systems or propose design solutions for robustness while there is a lack of results on how to elicit and specify robustness requirements. The research is typically solution proposals with little to no evaluation and when there is some evaluation it is primarily done with small, toy/academic example systems. Conclusion We conclude that there is a need for more software robustness research on real-world, industrial systems and on software development phases other than testing and design, in particular on requirements engineering."
249.0,Excluded,ec3,A taxonomy of design methods process models,"Context Designers and developers are increasingly expected to deliver high quality systems, i.e. systems that are usable, robust, consistent as well as evolutionary, and that fulfill usersâ€™ needs. To produce such systems, Design Methods suggest many approaches. However, the important number of existing approaches makes the choice of a method among the others particularly difficult. In addition to this, and because of the time required for understanding (and then operationalizing) new methods, designers tend to use already known methods, even though those which sometimes may not really be adapted to their needs. Objective This paper proposes a classification of characteristics of design methods process models. In other terms, it proposes a taxonomy that aims to facilitate the discovery and the choice of methods for designers and developers. Method From a study of process models of several design methods, we identify six main axes, namely Cycle, Collaboration, Artifacts, Recommended Use, Maturity and Flexibility, which are in turn divided into 34 characteristics. Results This paper provides a deep theorical insight. For each characteristic identified from relevant literature, a definition and a gradation, illustrated using examples, are given. Moreover, it presents a web site that offers various tools for exploring the axes of our taxonomy. This web site provides an overview of process models as well as means for comparing them, textually or graphically. Finally, the paper relates the first evaluation conducted in order to estimate designersâ€™ adhesion to the taxonomy in terms of easiness of learning, completeness and intention to use. Conclusion We show, based on evaluation results, that our taxonomy of process models facilitates the discovery of new methods and helps designers in choosing suitable methods, really adapted to their needs. Therefore, it enhances chances to conduct high quality projects."
250.0,Excluded,ec3,A TDD approach to introducing students to embedded programming,"Learning embedded programming is a highly demanding exercise. The beginner is bombarded with complexity from the start: embedded production based around a myriad of C++ constructs with low-level elements integrated onto ever more complicated processor architectures. The picture is further compounded by tool support having unfamiliar roles and appearances from previous student experiences. This demanding situation often has the student bewildered; seeking for ""a crutch"" or the simplest way forward regardless of the overall consequences. To control this potentially chaotic picture, the instructor needs to introduce devices to combat this complexity. We argue that test driven development (TDD) should become the instructor's principal weapon in this fight. Reasons for this belief combined with our, and the students', experiences with this novel approach are discussed."
251.0,Excluded,ec3,A teamwork model for understanding an agile team: A case study of a Scrum project,"Context Software development depends significantly on team performance, as does any process that involves human interaction. Objective Most current development methods argue that teams should self-manage. Our objective is thus to provide a better understanding of the nature of self-managing agile teams, and the teamwork challenges that arise when introducing such teams. Method We conducted extensive fieldwork for 9&#xa0;months in a software development company that introduced Scrum. We focused on the human sensemaking, on how mechanisms of teamwork were understood by the people involved. Results We describe a project through Dickinson and McIntyreâ€™s teamwork model, focusing on the interrelations between essential teamwork components. Problems with team orientation, team leadership and coordination in addition to highly specialized skills and corresponding division of work were important barriers for achieving team effectiveness. Conclusion Transitioning from individual work to self-managing teams requires a reorientation not only by developers but also by management. This transition takes time and resources, but should not be neglected. In addition to Dickinson and McIntyreâ€™s teamwork components, we found trust and shared mental models to be of fundamental importance."
252.0,Included,included,A Technical Story,"Across the agile community there has been a lot of discussion regarding the use of technical stories. While the community seems split into two camps of for and against, the majority of extreme programmers favour to define the system using only the traditional customer focused user stories. In some cases the technical story arguments are academic, but our experience report demonstrates clearly why sticking to user stories has its benefits. Our experience using Scrum and XP has been that allowing technical stories into the process can de-rail the ability to deliver constant, measurable business value per iteration, as well as inhibit the planning process. Once technical stories are allowed, the customer and business can be alienated very quickly, especially when they have no engineering background. Furthermore, when problems occur and the technical stories begin to slip, the customer can be left in a very difficult position, not knowing how to re- prioritise or direct the process. It is therefore our intention to highlight some of the pitfalls that can result from using technical stories."
253.0,Excluded,ec3,A technique fordefining agent-oriented engineering processes with tool support,"The formalization of engineering processes is necessary for guaranteeing the quality and cost of the products involved. Agent-oriented engineering has already proposed development processes that still need to be further formalized to be applicable by non-researchers. This paper proposes a technique to instantiate processes for specific agent-oriented methodologies. This technique is based on three orthogonal views that are respectively related with lifecycles, disciplines and guidances. In addition, processes are modeled with a tool, which is automatically generated from a process metamodel inspired by the software &amp; systems process engineering metamodel. Accordingly, engineers can choose the methodologyâ€“process pair best-suited for the characteristics of their project. The paper illustrates the approach based on the unified development process and the scrum process for the \{INGENIAS\} methodology and compares the results with other existing alternatives."
254.0,Excluded,ec3,A tentative framework for connecting long-term business and product planning with iterative & incremental software product development,"For a company in the software product business, it is essential to understand how to connect business management and software development [17] and employ a solid, value-based approach in its decision-making. However, software engineering literature (SE) commonly addresses what should be done at the ""floor level"" and leaves the link to business and product management unaddressed [14]. Also, existing software development models mostly adhere to the viewpoint of individual development projects and thus fail to sufficiently address common product development concerns such as multi-project or project portfolio management [20]."
255.0,Excluded,ec3,A test automation framework in POCT system using TDD techniques,"Nowadays, the growth of IT business are highly competitive both of development process and functionality of software to meet mostly customer requirements. Normally, software performance should develop to increase the high quality whilst it should reduce both of the cost and the time. The IT business is to start the attention with satisfaction of the customer for expanding opportunities of grown business. The problem of former software development is an operation under the pressure conditions affecting to see more bugs of the software in a period of testing system and delivering the program to the required customer. This paper presents an implementation of approach which is an agile development (If what we do that able to modify the code to meet the requirement in the future, that's call agile.) using Test Driven Development (TDD) in automation testing framework for software development process. It helps optimization of software testing as it can found early bug, flexible for requirement changes in the future, either to increase or change requirement without any effect on coding behavior. It also helps to reduce cost of software development as a human resource, time and rapid feedback of test result. We apply this approach with prototype in software development processes using the Point of care testing (POCT) system which is as an example to create test case with black-box and white-box testing techniques based on the requirements specification to improve more product quality."
256.0,Excluded,ec3,A test case refactoring approach for pattern-based software development,"In the current trend, Extreme Programing methodology is widely adopted by small and medium-sized projects for dealing with rapidly or indefinite changing requirements. Test-first strategy and code refactoring are the important practices of Extreme Programing for rapid development and quality support. The test-first strategy emphasizes that test cases are designed before system implementation to keep the correctness of artifacts during software development; whereas refactoring is the removal of “bad smell” code for improving quality without changing its semantics. However, the test-first strategy may conflict with code refactoring in the sense that the original test cases may be broken or inefficient for testing programs, which are revised by code refactoring. In general, the developers revise the test cases manually since it is not complicated. However, when the developers perform a pattern-based refactoring to improve the quality, the effort of revising the test cases is much more than that in simple code refactoring. In our observation, a pattern-based refactoring is composed of many simple and atomic code refactorings. If we have the composition relationship and the mapping rules between code refactoring and test case refactoring, we may infer a test case revision guideline in pattern-based refactoring. Based on this idea, in this research, we propose a four-phase approach to guide the construction of the test case refactoring for design patterns. We also introduce our approach by using some well-known design patterns and evaluate its feasibility by means of test coverage."
257.0,Excluded,ec3,A test-driven approach to code search and its application to the reuse of auxiliary functionality,"Context Software developers spend considerable effort implementing auxiliary functionality used by the main features of a system (e.g., compressing/decompressing files, encryption/decription of data, scaling/rotating images). With the increasing amount of open source code available on the Internet, time and effort can be saved by reusing these utilities through informal practices of code search and reuse. However, when this type of reuse is performed in an ad hoc manner, it can be tedious and error-prone: code results have to be manually inspected and integrated into the workspace. Objective In this paper we introduce and evaluate the use of test cases as an interface for automating code search and reuse. We call our approach Test-Driven Code Search (TDCS). Test cases serve two purposes: (1) they define the behavior of the desired functionality to be searched; and (2) they test the matching results for suitability in the local context. We also describe CodeGenie, an Eclipse plugin we have developed that performs \{TDCS\} using a code search engine called Sourcerer. Method Our evaluation consists of two studies: an applicability study with 34 different features that were searched using CodeGenie; and a performance study comparing CodeGenie, Google Code Search, and a manual approach. Results Both studies present evidence of the applicability and good performance of \{TDCS\} in the reuse of auxiliary functionality. Conclusion This paper presents an approach to source code search and its application to the reuse of auxiliary functionality. Our exploratory evaluation shows promising results, which motivates the use and further investigation of TDCS."

At the same time, hierarchical software design strategies such as component based software engineering are becoming necessary to overcome increasing software complexity. In this paper, we present a test-driven component development framework that encapsulates test code in a mirror component for automated testing during development, and as an executable semantic to simplify assessment and to increase trustworthiness of software systems."
260.0,Excluded,ec3,A test-first view of usability,"The foundations of usability evaluation were being established in the early 1990s. In this context, â€œUsability â€“ Context, Definition, Design and Evaluationâ€� built upon Brian Shackelâ€™s earlier influential work â€“ work that helped define the notion of usability. In this paper, he established key dimensions of usability as well as approaches to integrating the testing of these dimensions, within the whole process of setting requirements. Essentially he argued for usability design as part of the system design process. This commentary describes the context of Professor Shackelâ€™s paper and reviews the influential ideas that appear in much subsequent work."
261.0,Excluded,ec3,A Test-oriented Embedded System Production Methodology,"In the business world, the use of Agile methodologies has been demonstrated as providing a pro-active, rather than reactive, path for the developer to create defect-free products. Although similarities exist with business desktop and line-of-business systems, the closer connection of signal processing systems to the hardware side of a product, and associated physical constraints, makes the adaption of desktop Agile methodologies for the embedded world difficult; and the adoption of these methodologies by developers problematic. We focus on our experiences in developing test frameworks to support transforming a subset of extreme programming from the world of desktop applications into a suitable embedded domain production methodology. Details are provided of the issues surrounding an Embedded xUnit testing framework that will permit development of digital signal processing applications on a wide range of standalone and multi-processor systems in research, teaching and commercial development environments."
262.0,Excluded,ec3,A tool for controlling accelerometers. Secondary calibration data,"Abstract Vibration monitoring requires acceleration transducers capable of providing data with high precision. Accelerometers are the most frequently used vibration transducers. Their calibration plays an important role in measuring vibrations and is a key component in ensuring the integrity of the vibration measurement. For managing secondary calibration data of accelerometers, a database computer system was implemented. The implementation of this software has been an important step forward in providing a wide range of analysis and display tools. This paper reviews the main concepts involving accelerometer secondary calibration and describes the tool developed and the methods used in its development."
263.0,Excluded,ec3,A tool for incorporating unit testing into a Java programming curriculum,"In the development of object-oriented programming courses, an often overlooking but important area is testing. Generally, testing is formally introduced in software engineering courses and may not form part of the practical aspects of a programming course. As a result, this concept can play a de-emphasized role during the presentation of the course material. To counteract this problem, the HF2 (Highly Extendable and Flexible) unit testing framework was created. Its primary focus is the incorporation of unit testing into an object-oriented programming curriculum. HF2 provides students with the opportunity to develop and practice testing skills in a structured manner. This paper discusses the structure of the framework and the experiences gained when used in a university environment."

According to the requirement analysis for the FDD method application, an information system has been created providing all team members with instruments to follow the method. This tool has been implemented as a multi-user web-based application enabling creation of feature lists, planning a project, supporting cooperation among members of a feature-team, and tracking project progress in an illustrative way.

In this paper, the methodology of agile software design was applied to the domain of ecological models. Thus the principles for a universal design of ecological models were arrived at. To exemplify this design, the open-source software Universal Simulator was constructed using C++ and \{XML\} and is provided as a resource for inspiration."
266.0,Excluded,ec7,A Use Case Based Approach to Feature Models’ Construction,"In the research of software reuse, feature models have been widely adopted to organize the requirements of a set of applications in a software domain. However, there still lacks an effective approach to minimizing analysts' participation in feature models' construction. In this paper, we propose a use case based semi-automatic approach to the construction of feature models. The basic idea of this approach is to first construct a set of feature models for individual applications(called application feature models, AFMs) in a software domain, then adjust, and merge the set of AFMs to form a feature model for this domain (called a domain feature model, DFM). The main characteristic of this approach is that it provides a set of rules and algorithms to make the construction of AFMs (from use cases) and the construction of DFMs (by merging a set of AFMs) be carried out automatically"

To support the process improvement in small organizations, Agile development methods are very valuable. User Story is one of the important practices of Extreme Programming. To learn the development model of user story, the paper introduces a user story-driven software development method oriented to small organizations and projects. The method is helpful to requirement analysis, designing iteration plan and release plan, etc. The method is valuable for project team less than 10 people, which is proved by some projects."

In such system, user must be involved throughout the decision-making process. In consequence we propose the integration of a Humanâ€“Computer Interaction (HCI) model into the development of \{DSS\} process based on KDD. The approach we propose is based on two systems development methodsâ€”the Unified Process (UP) from Software Engineering and the U model from HCI. In this article, we describe our combined approach (UP/U) and the way we used it to develop a \{DSS\} in a medical field."
269.0,Excluded,ec3,A view of 20th and 21st century software engineering,"George Santayana's statement, ""Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,"" is only half true. The past also includes successful histories. If you haven't been made aware of them, you're often condemned not to repeat their successes.In a rapidly expanding field such as software engineering, this happens a lot. Extensive studies of many software projects such as the Standish Reports offer convincing evidence that many projects fail to repeat past successes.This paper tries to identify at least some of the major past software experiences that were well worth repeating, and some that were not. It also tries to identify underlying phenomena influencing the evolution of software engineering practices that have at least helped the author appreciate how our field has gotten to where it has been and where it is.A counterpart Santayana-like statement about the past and future might say, ""In an era of rapid change, those who repeat the past are condemned to a bleak future."" (Think about the dinosaurs, and think carefully about software engineering maturity models that emphasize repeatability.)This paper also tries to identify some of the major sources of change that will affect software engineering practices in the next couple of decades, and identifies some strategies for assessing and adapting to these sources of change. It also makes some first steps towards distinguishing relatively timeless software engineering principles that are risky not to repeat, and conditions of change under which aging practices will become increasingly risky to repeat."

We briefly describe our current practice what HCI and Media technology design and education (should) look like, being grounded on a vision of the future of area of interest as informal, not-necessarilly goal-directed and lightweight practice, associated the technology generation of ubiquitous computing, smartphone apps and the internet of things. It discusses some of the lessons learned from actual design, research and education, focussing on design as a exploratory process of mashing-up functions, services and presentations in the context learning by doing: doing research, doing design and doing learning from each other. Finally, having discussed the consequences of a Human Centred Creative Technology approach for design and for education, the main part of the paper discusses the content issues behind the developments in the area of HCI ad Media technology. This part discusses a number of attempts from the litterature to describe the developments, the need to identify a set of independent causal factors behind the developments, and the process and its results to arrive at a set of factors which help to understand, teach and anticipate the development from the desktop-oriented generation towards the ubiquitous, sensitive, smart, tangible, and networked ICT generation of the future."
272.0,Excluded,ec3,A Viterbi decoder architecture for a standard-agile and reprogrammable transceiver,"This paper presents a Viterbi decoder (VD) architecture for a programmable data transmission system, implemented using a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device. This \{VD\} has been conceived as a building block of a software defined radio (SDR) mobile transceiver, reconfigurable on request and capable to provide agility in choosing between different standards. \{UMTS\} and \{GPRS\} Viterbi decoding is achieved by choosing different coding rates and constraint lengths, and the possibility to switch, at run time, between them guarantees a high degree of programmability. The architecture has been tested and verified with a Xilinx \{XC2V2000\} \{FPGA\} for providing a generalized co-simulation/co-design testbed. The results show that this decoder can sustain an uncoded data rate of about 2&#xa0;Mbps, with an area occupancy of 46%, due to the efficient resources reuse."
273.0,Excluded,ec3,A web-based model for simulating whole-farm beef cattle systems,"This paper details the rationale and procedures included in a web-based simulator containing production of beef cattle and cash crops. All biophysical and economical definitions including management in terms of rules constitute user-defined scenarios, which can be saved, retrieved, modified and deleted. Herbage growth may be either provided by the user or estimated from daily climate information. Scenarios are simulated and their outcomes are sent to the user's e-mail as a spreadsheet file, including data and pre-designed graphs to facilitate the interpretation of results. An example simulation study of a grazing-based finishing beef steers with a cycle of 12 months is presented, where new weaners enter the system in the autumn. Increased stocking rates, \{SR\} (150, 170, 190 and 210 heads in a 100-ha farm) and different summer maize feeding (SMF) rates were compared (SMF0&#xa0;=&#xa0;control and SMF1&#xa0;=&#xa0;intermittent rule-driven maize feeding during summer). In this simulation study, â€œdeviationsâ€� from user-defined targets are simplified into two associated rules (a) average farm herbage mass deviation to adjust herbage allowance, and (b) target animal live weight deviation, associated to SMF1. The proportion of unfinished steers at 28th February increased linearly (p&#xa0;â‰¤&#xa0;0.01) with higher stocking rates and became zero at any stocking rate where the \{SMF\} rule was operating (SMF1). The economic response of SR&#xa0;Ã—&#xa0;SMF interaction was significant for gross margin, indicating a positive linear association (p&#xa0;â‰¤&#xa0;0.05) of \{SMF1\} treatment (rule activated) when \{SR\} increases. The potential use of the web simulator as a flexible tool for investigation, training and decision making are discussed."
274.0,Excluded,ec7,A web-centred approach to end-user software engineering,"This article addresses one of the major end-user software engineering (EUSE) challenges, namely, how to motivate end users to apply unfamiliar software engineering techniques and activities to achieve their goal: translate requirements into software that meets their needs. EUSE activities are secondary to the goal that the program is helping to achieve and end-user programming is opportunistic. The challenge is then to find ways to incorporate EUSE activities into the existing workflow without users having to make substantial changes to the type of work they do or their priorities. In this article, we set out an approach to EUSE for web-based applications. We also propose a software lifecycle that is consistent with the conditions and priorities of end users without programming skills and is well-aligned with EUSE's characteristic informality, ambiguity and opportunisticness. Users applying this lifecycle manage to find solutions that they would otherwise be unable to identify. They also develop quality products. Users of this approach will not have to be acquainted with software engineering, as a framework will take them through the web-centred EUSE lifecycle step-by-step. We also report a statistical experiment in which users develop web software with and without a framework to guide them through the lifecycle. Its aim is to validate the applicability of our framework-driven lifecycle."
275.0,Excluded,ec3,A wiki-based approach to method tailoring,"Tailoring systems development methods is a challenge. Both the research of method engineering and method-in-action have put much effort into this issue. State-of-the art Computer-Aided Method Engineering tools for situational method engineering often requires specific competences in meta modelling languages. Together with the tool investments they often become heavy weight solutions for small systems development companies that seek method tailoring support. In this paper a wiki-based approach to method tailoring, the Wiki Method Tool (WMT), has been evaluated during two systems development projects. The evaluation of this light weight tool has been carried out in a small systems development company in Sweden. The evaluation has been anchored in Activity Theory to focus on the collaborative actions on the situational methods using the WMT, such as changing work descriptions and templates. The WMT itself contributed with data about each documented change -- what the change looked like, by whom, and when it was made. Based on these data and subsequent interviews, we report on lessons learned and can conclude that all team members have contributed to the situational methods. It also means that they took a shared responsibility for the role as method engineer."
276.0,Included,included,A work product pool approach to methodology specification and enactment,"Software development methodologies advocated and used today, whether traditional and plan-based or contemporary and agile, usually focus on process steps i.e. they start with requirements and iteratively describe what steps are necessary to move to the next stage or phase, until the software application is delivered to the end user. Such a process-oriented view of methodologies, based on the metaphor that human organizations are â€œmachinesâ€� that â€œexecuteâ€� processes, often results in methodologies that are too rigid and hard to follow, and most often than not end up being ignored or bypassed. Our proposal here is that, since the ultimate aim of software development is to provide a software product, software development methodologies should be described in terms of the intermediate products that are necessary to reach such a final product, plus the needed micro-processes that, as necessary evils, will be required to produce the appropriate work products from other, previously created ones. Using this product-oriented approach, software development methodologies can be specified that are, at least, as flexible as lightweight, agile approaches and, at the same time, as powerful and scalable as plan-oriented ones."

However, the reality may not be as simple or linear as this label implies. To provide a better understanding of lean software development approaches and how they are applied in agile software development, we have examined 30 experience reports published in past agile software conferences in which experiences of applying lean approaches in agile software development were reported. The analysis identified six types of lean application. The results of our study show that lean can be applied in agile processes in different manners for different purposes. Lean concepts, principles and practices are most often used for continuous agile process improvement, with the most recent introduction being the kanban approach, introducing a continuous, flow-based substitute to time-boxed agile processes."

As this approach requires a consistent structure, our concept proposes an adaption of Scrum that is based on the game development life-cycle: ABC-Sprints consist of three Sprints to iteratively create Alpha, Beta and Completed versions of a game. We present a detailed walkthrough of the course and give results of a formal evaluation. These indicate that ABC-Sprints help students to manage their workload and to increase productivity over time. Consequently, three teams each presented a game at the end of the course that technically exceeded typical outcomes of game projects without lectures. We hence encourage to apply ABC-Sprints to other curricula and provide a set of recommendations."

Nevertheless, their deployment often encounters resistance from systems developers. Agile methodologies, the latest batch of \{SDMs\} that are most suitable in dealing with volatile business requirements, are likely to face the same challenge as they require developers to drastically change their work habits and acquire new skills. This paper addresses what can be done to overcome the challenge to agile methodologies acceptance. We provide a critical review of the extant literature on the acceptance of traditional \{SDMs\} and agile methodologies, and develop a conceptual framework for agile methodologies acceptance based on a knowledge management perspective. This framework can provide guidance for future research into acceptance of agile methodologies, and has implications for practitioners concerned with the effective deployment of agile methodologies."

In traditional software development models requirements are predefined and sent to the developers to do analysis from various stakeholders. Requirement elicitation and quality related to requirements are the challenging issues in the software development life cycle. XP, recommend an on-site customer to represents their requirements through user stories on story cards. Generally customers have rarely a general picture of the requirements or system in their mind which leads problems related to requirements like requirements conflicts, missing requirements, and ambiguous requirements etc, and not address non-functional requirements from exploration phase. Two third of the projects are failed because of ambiguous and incomplete user requirements, and poor quality of the requirements. Acceptance testing is also one of the key issues, which is often left unsolved or uncovered to verify user requirements in XP (Agile software development methodology). To solve these problems we propose A New Improved Requirement Elicitation (Gathering) Process framework for story cards in XP to improve quality of user stories to capture functional and non-functional user requirements on story cards. Our approach involves adopting acceptance tests right from story cards as soon as requirements are clearly understood. We also aim to demonstrate how acceptance test will improve story card driven agile software development (XP). We believe this will enhance the popularity of Agile based software development."

From then until 2009, Scrum spread to a large portion of the software development teams at Amazon. This widespread adoption occurred in part due to the actions of a single individual and in part due to the natural match between Scrumpsilas characteristics and the culture prevalent at Amazon.com. Widespread use of small, independent teams and a general empowerment at the team level made Scrum a smaller step to take for development teams at Amazon than it would be at many companies of equal or greater size. The success of Scrum at Amazon shows how important the prevailing culture of the company can be in terms of supporting an Agile transformation. These lessons are relevant to Scrum transformations being undertaken at many companies today."

324.0,Included,included,Acquiring and sharing tacit knowledge in software development teams: An empirical study,"AbstractContext Sharing expert knowledge is a key process in developing software products. Since expert knowledge is mostly tacit, the acquisition and sharing of tacit knowledge along with the development of a transactive memory system (TMS) are significant factors in effective software teams. Objective We seek to enhance our understanding human factors in the software development process and provide support for the agile approach, particularly in its advocacy of social interaction, by answering two questions: How do software development teams acquire and share tacit knowledge? What roles do tacit knowledge and transactive memory play in successful team performance? Method A theoretical model describing the process for acquiring and sharing tacit knowledge and development of a \{TMS\} through social interaction is presented and a second predictive model addresses the two research questions above. The elements of the predictive model and other demographic variables were incorporated into a larger online survey for software development teams, completed by 46 software SMEs, consisting of 181 individual team members. Results Our results show that team tacit knowledge is acquired and shared directly through good quality social interactions and through the development of a \{TMS\} with quality of social interaction playing a greater role than transactive memory. Both \{TMS\} and team tacit knowledge predict effectiveness but not efficiency in software teams. Conclusion It is concluded that \{TMS\} and team tacit knowledge can differentiate between low- and high-performing teams in terms of effectiveness, where more effective teams have a competitive advantage in developing new products and bringing them to market. As face-to-face social interaction is key, collocated, functionally rich, domain expert teams are advocated rather than distributed teams, though arguably the team manager may be in a separate geographic location provided that there is frequent communication and effective use of issue tracking tools as in agile teams."

In our experiences with off shoring Japanese software development projects to China, we were having difficulties with low quality deliverables and high turnover rate of Chinese members because of social differences. Our attempts to create a common culture were not very successful because people in general are less likely to change their basic views and behavior in a short period of time. We, however, were able to obtain success by acknowledging that differences are going to exist and adopting and adapting agile practices in consideration of the existence of these differences. We will show Kaizen as is used by a Japanese company in software development. We will focus on our experiences with social differences we've found and how we continuously adapted practices in our project to take better advantage of the situation as relationship between members changed. It is based on our over 10 years of experience in trying to improve a software package development at a software company in China, which has now become our subsidiary. During our attempts, we have learned the importance of agile mentality in resolving value difference issues. We believe what we've learned in adapting agile practices is not just limited to our particular project but can be useful in agile projects in general and thus can be used to assist resolve value differences in organizations as well."

328.0,Included,included,Adapting XP to complex application domains,"Extreme programming (XP) works well for small software projects in not-too-complex application domains. In many of these projects the rather simple requirements engineering of XP (customers write story cards) has proved suitable. But today we are more often faced with complex application domains in which the classical XP techniques will not suffice. The tutorial shows how to adapt extreme programming to complex application domains and to demanding development tasks. We focus mainly on the requirements engineering part and show how to enhance XP with interviews, scenarios and system visions.

This new generation of hand-held wireless devices, also named always-best-connected systems, will require low-power and low-cost multi-standard chips, capable of operating over different co-existing communication protocols, signal conditions, battery status, etc. Moreover, the efficient implementation of these chipsets will demand for reconfigurable radio frequency (RF) and mixed-signal circuits that can adapt to the large number of specifications with minimum power dissipation at the lowest cost. Nanometer \{CMOS\} processes are expected to be the base technologies to develop 4G systems, assuring mass production at low cost through increased integration levels and extensive use of digital signal processing. However, the integration in standard \{CMOS\} of increasingly complex analog/RF parts imposes a number of challenges and trade-offs that make their design critical. These challenges are addressed in this paper through a comprehensive revision of the state-of-the-art on transceiver architectures, building blocks and design trade-offs of reconfigurable and adaptive \{CMOS\} \{RF\} and mixed-signal circuits for emerging 4G systems."
330.0,Excluded,ec7,Adaptive Detection of Design Flaws,"Criteria for software quality measurement depend on the application area. In large software systems criteria like maintainability, comprehensibility and extensibility play an important role. My aim is to identify design flaws in software systems automatically and thus to avoid â€œbadâ€� â€” incomprehensible, hardly expandable and changeable â€” program structures. Depending on the perception and experience of the searching engineer, design flaws are interpreted in a different way. I propose to combine known methods for finding design flaws on the basis of metrics with machine learning mechanisms, such that design flaw detection is adaptable to different views. This paper presents the underlying method, describes an analysis tool for Java programs and shows results of an initial case study."
331.0,Excluded,ec3,Ad-hoc leadership in agile software development environments,"Leadership is the ability to influence people, leading them to behave in a certain way in order to achieve the group's goals. Leadership is independent of job titles and descriptions. Usually, however, in order to lead, leaders need the power derived from their organizational positions. There are different leadership styles, like task-oriented versus people-oriented, directive versus permissive, autocrat versus democrat. In this paper, we examine the leadership concept in software development environments and focus on leadership in transition processes to agile software development. Specifically, based on our comprehensive research on agile software development, we suggest a leadership style - ad-hoc leadership - that usually emerges in such change processes. We present the characteristics, dynamic and uniqueness of this leadership style and illustrate its usefulness for the analysis of representative scenarios."

This paper lays some groundwork for a pattern language that will facilitate the transition to agility. We introduce patterns that focus on the dynamics of adoption rather than the structure that results from adoption. To establish the desired foundation it is necessary to ""push the pattern envelope"" in terms of traditional pattern documentation format and relationships among patterns that form a pattern language."

These methodologies, such as Scrum, eXtreme Programming (XP), and Feature-Driven Development (FDD) date back to 1990s, and the Agile Manifesto was declared in 2001. However, already before that the concept of agile manufacturing (AM) was discovered to describe a corporate ability for quick adaptation to changing requirements. There is surprising amount in common between these two fields. This raises a question of whether NPD software development companies could take even more overall advantage of those different agile approaches. This interdisciplinary paper explores the commonalities between the key concepts of AM and some of the most popular agile software methods, and consequently suggests potential new areas for software process improvement (SPI) in large-scale NPD organizations. An industrial case example illustrates how agility in embedded software product development can be enhanced by following typical NPD principles. We conclude that there is potential for further improvements in software product development industry in general by seeing agility as a wider, organization-oriented business concept following the AM/NPD learning. Current agile software process models cover only a subset of this space. Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
343.0,Included,included,Adoption of XP practices in the industry - A survey,"Agile software development has recently become popular in the software industry. The methodologies in the Agile family are considered to be based on best practices. The most popular approach, Extreme Programming (XP), recommends certain best practices during the requirements gathering, implementation and testing phases of software development. In this paper, the authors analyze the best practices according to data from recent case studies and survey studies to see if and how they are followed. Metaphor was the least used practice, while unit testing was one of the most popular. Most of the practices varied across studies and projects. Agile software development is evolutionary in nature, so customizing the practices is still well within its sounds. Copyright Â© 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
344.0,Excluded,ec3,Advanced empirical testing,"In todayâ€™s industrial applications, we see that knowledge systems are successfully implemented. However, critical domains require the elaborate and thoughtful validation of the knowledge bases before the deployment. Empirical testing, also known as regression testing, denotes the most popular validation technique, where predefined test cases are used to simulate and review the correct behavior of the system. In this paper, we motivate that the classic notions of a test case and the corresponding measures are not sufficient in many application scenarios. We present enhanced notions generalizing the standard test case, and we show appropriate extensions of the measures precision and recall, that work on these test case notions. Furthermore, the effective inspection of test runs is important whenever test cases fail. We introduce a novel visualization technique that allows for the effective and intuitive analysis of test cases and test run outcomes. The new visualization is useful for debugging a knowledge base and test case, respectively, but it also provides an intuitive overview of the status of the entire test suite. A case study reports on the (repeated) validation of a medical decision-support system and demonstrates the practical relevance of the presented work."

In this article, the Radio Resource Management (RRM) spectrum functionalities are defined and subsequently analyzed. The proposed RRM spectrum architecture developed will result in reducing the time required to tailor new services to network operators. Furthermore, the flexible spectrum access and usage leads to more capab e and faster services with high Quality-of-Service (QoS) giving more user satisfaction than conventional networks. The inherent centralization and decentralization degree for the functionalities is outlined and discussed since flexible spectrum techniques on both fast and slow basis will lead to a better utilization of spectrum."
346.0,Excluded,ec3,Advances on Improving Automation in Developer Testing,"Abstract Developer testing, a common step in software development, involves generating desirable test inputs and checking the behavior of the program unit under test during the execution of the test inputs. Existing developer testing tools include various techniques to address challenges of generating desirable test inputs and checking the behavior of the program unit under test (referred to as test oracles). In this chapter, we present an overview of techniques implemented in these testing tools to address challenges in improving automation in developer testing. In particular, we focus on a recent state-of-the-art technique, called symbolic execution for test inputs. We briefly describe symbolic execution and discuss various challenges (along with the techniques developed to address those challenges) in generating test inputs automatically. For test inputs, the techniques presented in our chapter are summarized from two main aspects: test efficiency (e.g., with a focus on cost) and test effectiveness (e.g., with a focus on benefit). We conclude this chapter by presenting a new frontier, called cooperative developer testing, that is orthogonal to previous techniques and involves synergistic cooperation between humans and tools for effectively generating desirable test inputs."

Now a third opportunity presents itself with Alexander's recent publication, The Nature of Order. Serious apprenticeship, however, imposes a prerequisite of sober self-reflection and evaluation. What, really, is the nature of the developer's tasks? Under what philosophical umbrella has the software community matured until now? Do other philosophical traditions offer alternative and perhaps more pertinent epistemologies? What voices, besides Alexander's, might contribute to the community's evolution? We address these questions along with theory building, ethnography, weak links, design heuristics, agility, and complex systems, all of which combine with Alexander's new theories to suggest different ways of doing what we do, better."

The system is integrated around a spatial, state-dependent cost-to-go (SVF) function that is computed as an approximation to the value function associated with the optimal trajectory planning problem. The function captures the critical interaction between the vehicle dynamics and environment, thereby resulting in tighter coupling between planning and control. The consistency achieved between the \{RH\} optimization and the \{SVF\} enables a more rigorous implementation of the \{RH\} framework to autonomous vehicle guidance.

We have interviewed both internals and customers to investigate the practicalities, costs, gains and prerequisites of such a transition. We have gathered data from a period of two years covering four consecutive release projects using the new process and analyzed the material in detail. Our findings implicate that close customer engagement does give certain benefits but that it comes with a cost and needs careful attention to management."

However, evidence suggests that not all development environments have evolved with the same alacrity, thus an organization's inherent culture may not match the development approach adopted effecting failure. This paper concerns an innovative, real-world Government \{IS\} project that is currently being implemented in the \{UK\} that reflects such a situation. The paper looks at the tension that transpired between the bureaucratic project arena and the Agile development approach. It examines stakeholdersâ€™ behaviour and attitudes borne from a bureaucratic and hierarchical society that were problematic for Agile development. It further explores the issues of conflict and trust that prevented key stakeholders from building and fostering a collaborative and co-operative collective with the Developers that had significant impact. The case study provides evidential insights into the phenomenon of stakeholder control over critical decision-making activities that prevailed over organizational driven strategies that has implications for practice."

This special session will help us work together in agile ways to better understand the importance and role(s) of agile concepts and practices, successful ways to incorporate them in academic settings, potential pitfalls, and key questions that should be explored further. We want to gather input from a wide range of people in different sub-disciplines and programs.We will begin with a very brief overview of agile concepts and practices, followed by brief statements from each of the five speakers, to give other participants a sense of the range of possibilities (25 min). Next, we will poll participants to identify a set of topics within agility that they want to discuss further (5 min). Participants will then gather into subgroups for each topic, and each subgroup will identify best practices, interesting ideas, and open questions for that topic (30-35 min). Each subgroup will then give a brief report to the entire group, and we will conclude with a few minutes of general discussion (10-15 min)."

There are however concerns that the higher development pace and lack of documentation are creating less secure software. We have therefore looked at three known Security Engineering processes, Microsoft SDL, Cigatel touchpoints and Common Criteria and identified what specific security activities they performed. We then compared these activities with an Agile development process that is used in industry. Developers, from a large telecommunication manufacturer, were interviewed to learn their impressions on using these security activities in an agile development process.

373.0,Excluded,ec3,Agile development: evaluation and experience,"Agile methods such as Extreme Programming, Crystal, Scrum, and others have attracted a lot of attention recently. Agile methods stress early and continuous delivery of software, welcome changing requirements, and value early feedback from customers. Agile methods seek to cut out inefficiency, bureaucracy, and anything that adds no value to a software product. Proponents of agile methods often see software specification and documentation as adding no value, which has led observers to conclude that agile development is nothing but unprincipled hacking, perhaps even an anarchic counter-reaction to bureaucratic, heavyweight software processes that demand ever more intermediate deliverables from developers. The purpose of this panel is to discuss under what circumstances agile methods work and don't work. Some of the key practices of agile methods are: scheduling according to feature priorities, incremental delivery of software, feedback from expert users, emphasis on face-to-face communication, pair development, minimalist design combined with refactoring, test-driven development, automated regression testing, daily integration, self-organizing teams, and periodic tuning of the methods. Working software is the primary measure of success. Find out what the latest practical experience with agile methods is and learn about the latest thinking in this area."
375.0,Included,included,Agile development: issues and avenues requiring a substantial enhancement of the business perspective in large projects,"Large-scale projects, are often delivering low value software to businesses due to stakeholders' misunderstanding. Evolutionary software development represents an alternative to plan-driven development in order to tackle today's turbulent environments. In agile development, a type of evolutionary development, the product owner (P.O.) who is the customer representative---real accountable role---is ill-equipped to identify and prioritize the stakeholders' most success-critical expectations and potential sources of business value. Furthermore, the tools he can use have their own scalability issues that question their underlying principles. Moreover, without a substantial involvement to take into account all stakeholders, software providers are more likely acting as commodity-utility providers than real business partners. In today's business context, there is a clear need for a value-driven development which embraces changes along with higher visibility and understanding of business transformations.
The current problems of software crisis could be condensed in a twofold business perspective dilemma: Doing the right product and providing efficient guidance to the development project. Approaches based on goals have been successfully used in Requirements Engineering (RE) and IT governance to address issues similar to the current software crisis. Commonalities in motivations behind the use of goals in both domains can open new avenues for improving the business perspective in Scrum. A goal-value oriented approach is then proposed as a candidate approach to balance the stakeholders' needs and expectations for large-scale agile developments and ensure focus on delivering high value functionalities."

379.0,Included,included,Agile enterprise software development using domain-driven design and test first,"In this paper we present the experience gained and lessons learned when the IT department at Statoil ASA, a large Oil and Gas company in Norway, applied Domain-Driven design techniques in combination with agile software development practices to assess the software architecture of our next generation oil trading and supply chain application. Our hypothesis was that the use of object oriented techniques, domain driven design and a proper object-relational mapping tool would significantly improve the performance and reduce the code base compared with current legacy systems. The legacy system is based on several Oracle databases serving a variety of clients written in Java, Gupta Centura Team Developer and HTML. The databases have a layer of business logic written in PL/SQL offering various system services to the clients. To validate our new object-oriented software architecture, we re-implemented one of the most computationally heavy and data intensive services using Test First and Domain-Driven design techniques. The resulting software was then tested on a set of servers with a representative subset of data from the production environment.We found that using these techniques improved our software architecture with respect to performance as well as code quality when running on top of our Oracle databases.We also tested the switch to an object database from Versant and achieved additional performance gains."

The problem is to identify what are the things that are used often, what are the things that not used, and which ones are worthy of investing our time in improving. To determine these points precisely from technical perspective this paper analyzes the data from several technical aspects. Usually an upgrade is worth up to 1/3 of initial investment and this approach has helped us achieve productive ERP system development environment, and enabled us to perform an ERP system upgrade to second next version, skipping a whole version, which is even more worthier. The analysis that was performed is shown to be advantageous in the way of quantitative technical approach, in comparison to previous, more soft skills oriented, approaches."

The roll-out started earlier, and is continuing after this period, and many more people contributed to the implementation. We learned that following an organizational change pattern (we used Kotter’s eight step processi) is helpful to structure the program, and made us aware of where we were, and what needed doing first. We found some issues, and while working on this paper discovered that others have found similar patterns, most notably Linda Rising in her book “Fearless Change”ii. Obstacles we found include the necessity to obtain and maintain support of leadership, the influence of tooling on the implementation, and the need to go step-by-step: get agile skills in teams before attempting to change the full Software Development Life Cycle. We had great results from made-to-measure training of the teams around the globe, from finding a pace-maker process in the development process, and from the support of people who lead actual development programs."

Using a technique called Agile Hours it is possible to convey many feelings associated with an Extreme Programming project. Within 70 minutes, a project is performed in which a product is built with Lego bricks. We applied this approach to (1) students and (2) IT professionals. By comparing the two groups, we found that both behaved comparable: we observed a number of interesting differences, although of minor importance. Both groups seemed to benefit from the Agile (Lego) Hours. Â© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005."

As agile representatives of SE, Extreme Programming (XP) and Agile Modeling (AM) contribute helpful principles and practices for a common engineering approach. We present a cross-discipline user interface design lifecycle that integrates SE and HCI under the umbrella of agile development. Melting IT budgets, pressure of time and the demand to build better software in less time must be supported by traveling as light as possible. We did, therefore, choose not just to mediate both disciplines. Following our surveys, a rather radical approach best fits the demands of engineering organizations."

With the design period is cut down greatly, in order to improve design quality on the current situation of industrial design in China, this paper proposes the method of agile industrial design, and builds the agility model with three major factors of dynamic team, lightweight process, and flexible methods. The method is adapted to the conceptual design process filled with uncertainty, especially in creativity and demand. Based on it, the paper introduces Scrum used in software development and analyzes its usability in the industrial design.

390.0,Excluded,ec3,Agile management and development of software projects based on collaborative environments,"We've heard of Agile methodologies for several years, but software projects have still delays and failures in planning and management. How then automate the processes of the development of software projects following agile methodologies? In this paper we try to answer this question by proposing an appropriate use of collaborative environments for software development that effectively translated into action the principles and practices of Agile methodologies. The appropriate use of these collaborative environments leads to a truly agile management, where the project manager achieves the vision and the continuous monitoring of the project, and the participants become adapted to an agile and productive discipline imposed by the environment, regardless if they are geographically dispersed. To ensure that appropriate use, this paper proposes a methodological guide to achieve an agile management of software projects by relying on a particular collaborative environment."
391.0,Included,included,Agile management of uncertain requirements via generalizations: a case study,"A major justification for the agile class of software processes is that customer requirements often change substantially during development, with the result that developers must work with a ever-changing specification. The best way of dealing with this, it is claimed, is a process including adaptive and iterative steps allowing the code under development to change to meet an evolving requirement. In this paper, we use quantitative process data to argue that the deliberate development of an evolvable design, based upon extensions and variations to the requirements, and the generality derivable from the implemented system, may provide agility within a more traditional development, showing that the two concepts are interchangeable, to some extent. In doing so, the paper draws upon our joint work on evolvable systems, and upon a concept developed by one of us in the 1980's, ""The Contraction of Generality"", to illustrate the alternatives."

The sequential and plan-driven traditional approaches often do not allow for an adequate reaction to changes in requirements. Today, Extreme Programming (XP) is the most popular agile development methodology. This paper analyzes how and to what extent XP can be transferred to distributed development projects for large enterprise applications. The focus is on XP in particular, since it is the most common agile methodology in practice and has the highest congruence to the original Agile Manifesto."

This is particularly true for the requirements engineering area, where agile methods neglect some of the documentation and control procedures traditionally used in its process. This work is an effort to extend Scrum so it becomes compatible with CMMI Requirements Management and Development process areas. We analyze Scrum and define some guidelines to meet the requisites of both process areas that are currently not addressed in Scrum. We applied and validated these guidelines in a software development organization. The results show that is possible to use agile methods with CMMI model, as long as the organization is prepared to apply new approaches. Copyright Â© (2007) by Knowledge Systems Institute (KSI)."

Five agile methods are considered: eXtreme Programming, Scrum, Crystal, Dynamic Systems Development Method and Adaptive Software Development. We analyze how well these methods implement the basic goals of requirements engineering, how they counteract or support the occurrence of requirements changes and how they cope with problems arising from changing requirements. We show that agile methods provide a valid approach for requirements related issues, but also identify their weaknesses."

397.0,Excluded,ec3,Agile methods for open source safety-critical software,"The introduction of software technology in a life-dependent environment requires the development team to execute a process that ensures a high level of software reliability and correctness. Despite their popularity, agile methods are generally assumed to be inappropriate as a process family in these environments due to their lack of emphasis on documentation, traceability, and other formal techniques. Agile methods, notably Scrum, favor empirical process control, or small constant adjustments in a tight feedback loop. This paper challenges the assumption that agile methods are inappropriate for safety-critical software development. Agile methods are flexible enough to encourage the right amount of ceremony; therefore if safety-critical systems require greater emphasis on activities, such as formal specification and requirements management, then an agile process will include these as necessary activities. Furthermore, agile methods focus more on continuous process management and code-level quality than classic software engineering process models. We present our experiences on the image-guided surgical toolkit (IGSTK) project as a backdrop. IGSTK is an open source software project employing agile practices since 2004. We started with the assumption that a lighter process is better, focused on evolving code, and only adding process elements as the need arose. IGSTK has been adopted by teaching hospitals and research labs, and used for clinical trials. Agile methods have matured since the academic community suggested almost a decade ago that they were not suitable for safety-critical systems; we present our experiences as a case study for renewing the discussion.

398.0,Excluded,ec3,Agile methods in biomedical software development: a multi-site experience report,"Agile is an iterative approach to software development that relies on strong collaboration and automation to keep pace with dynamic environments. We have successfully used agile development approaches to create and maintain biomedical software, including software for bioinformatics. This paper reports on a qualitative study of our experiences using these methods. We have found that agile methods are well suited to the exploratory and iterative nature of scientific inquiry. They provide a robust framework for reproducing scientific results and for developing clinical support systems. The agile development approach also provides a model for collaboration between software engineers and researchers. We present our experience using agile methodologies in projects at six different biomedical software development organizations. The organizations include academic, commercial and government development teams, and included both bioinformatics and clinical support applications. We found that agile practices were a match for the needs of our biomedical projects and contributed to the success of our organizations. We found that the agile development approach was a good fit for our organizations, and that these practices should be applicable and valuable to other biomedical software development efforts. Although we found differences in how agile methods were used, we were also able to identify a set of core practices that were common to all of the groups, and that could be a focus for others seeking to adopt these methods."
399.0,Excluded,ec3,Agile methods rapidly replacing traditional methods at Nokia: A survey of opinions on agile transformation,"Context Many organizations have started to deploy agile methods, but so far there exist only a few studies on organization-wide transformations. Are agile methods here to stay? Some claim that agile software development methods are in the mainstream adoption phase in the software industry, while others hope that those are a passing fad. The assumption here is that if agile would not provide real improvement, adopters would be eager at first but turn pessimistic after putting it into practice. Objective Despite the growing amount of anecdotal evidence on the success of agile methods across a wide range of different real-life development settings, scientific studies remain scarce. Even less is known about the perception of the impacts of agile transformation when it is deployed in a very large software development environment, and whether agile methods are here to stay. This study aims to fill that gap by providing evidence from a large-scale agile transformation within Nokia. While we have yet to confirm these findings with solid quantitative data, we believe that the perception of the impacts already pinpoints the direction of the impacts of large-scale agile transformation. Method The data were collected using a questionnaire. The population of the study contains more than 1000 respondents in seven different countries in Europe, North America, and Asia. Results The results reveal that most respondents agree on all accounts with the generally claimed benefits of agile methods. These benefits include higher satisfaction, a feeling of effectiveness, increased quality and transparency, increased autonomy and happiness, and earlier detection of defects. Finally, 60% of respondents would not like to return to the old way of working. Conclusion While the perception of the impact of agile methods is predominantly positive, several challenge areas were discovered. However, based on this study, agile methods are here to stay."

Some common terms related to agile practices (e.g. scrum, extreme programming) were considered in formulating the search strings, along with a number of alternatives for GSE such as offshoring, outsourcing, and virtual teams. The results were limited to peer-reviewed conference papers/journal articles, published between 1999 and 2009. The synthesis was made through classifying the papers into different categories (e.g. research type, distribution). The analysis revealed that in most cases agile practices were modified with respect to the context and situational requirements.

422.0,Included,included,Agile product line planning: A collaborative approach and a case study,"Agile methods and product line engineering (PLE) have both proven successful in increasing customer satisfaction and decreasing time to market under certain conditions. Key characteristics of agile methods are lean and highly iterative development with a strong emphasis on stakeholder involvement. \{PLE\} leverages reuse through systematic approaches such as variability modeling or product derivation. Integrating agile approaches with product line engineering is an interesting proposition which â€“ not surprisingly â€“ entails several challenges: Product lines (PL) rely on complex plans and models to ensure their long-term evolution while agile methods emphasize simplicity and short-term value-creation for customers. When incorporating agility in product line engineering, it is thus essential to define carefully how agile principles can support particular \{PLE\} processes. For instance, the processes of defining and setting up a product line (domain engineering) and deriving products (application engineering) differ significantly in practices and focus with implications on the suitability of agile principles. This paper presents practical experiences of adopting agile principles in product line planning (a domain engineering activity). ThinkLets, i.e., collaborative practices from the area of collaboration engineering, are the building blocks of the presented approach as they codify agile principles such as stakeholder involvement, rapid feedback, or value-based prioritization. We discuss how our approach balances agility and the intrinsic needs of product line planning.

This exploratory study sets out to uncover the concepts that practitioners in a large software organization use in the prioritization process and the practices that they deem good. We seek to provide a rich analysis and a deep understanding of three cases in an exploratory study that was carried out in a large and mature company, widely recognized for its excellence and its engagement in outsourced software development. We used in-depth interviews for data collection and grounded theory techniques for data analysis. Our exploration efforts yielded the following findings: (i) understanding requirements dependencies is of paramount importance for the successful deployment of agile approaches in large outsourced projects. (ii) Next to business value, the most important prioritization criterion in the setting of outsourced large agile projects is risk. (iii) The software organization has developed a new artefact that seems to be a worthwhile contribution to agile software development in the large: â€˜delivery storiesâ€™, which complement user stories with technical implications, effort estimation and associated risk. The delivery stories play a pivotal role in requirements prioritization. (iv) The vendor's domain knowledge is a key asset for setting up successful client-developer collaboration. (v) The use of agile prioritization practices depends on the type of project outsourcing arrangement. Our findings contribute to the empirical software engineering literature by bringing a rich analysis of cases in agile and distributed contexts, from a vendor's perspective. We also discuss the possible implications of the results for research and in practice."

But no matter what, a software project will have an architecture, whether documented intentionally or created on the fly. Software Architecture should enable Agile development methods by itself being Agile. But how? In this paper, I will discuss my experience of doing architecture in an Agile way and in a non-Agile way. Have an architecture that follows the Agile principles is key to obtaining success in an Agile development environment."
433.0,Included,included,Agile software development and its compatibility with a document-driven approach? A case study,"It is generally assumed among software developers and managers that a document-driven development process is incompatible with an agile development process. There are few reports on this issue and even less empirical research documenting the assumed incompatibility. More and more software companies however have a desire to adopt agile development processes while maintaining compliance with a quality assurance standard or even a process standard. We have studied the software development process of a Danish pharmaceutical company. For market reasons the company has to comply the US Food and Drug Administration's standards for software development. The company has also successfully implemented significant parts of the agile methodology Scrum. We describe this case and we analyse using Soft Systems Methodology how well the development process combines these diverging sets of process requirements. We find that despite much effort the agile development process suffers from its adaptation to the FDA standard, but at the same time many of the genuine qualities of an agile process have been maintained. From this case study we discuss the implications for development companies facing the challenge of implementing a mixed development approach. Â© 2009 Heeager & Nielsen."

The paper details the simple process changes that were adopted to expand the agile philosophy beyond development.
436.0,Excluded,ec3,Agile Software Development Methodologies and Practices,"Beginning in the mid-1990s, a number of consultants independently created and evolved what later came to be known as agile software development methodologies. Agile methodologies and practices emerged as an attempt to more formally and explicitly embrace higher rates of change in software requirements and customer expectations. Some prominent agile methodologies are Adaptive Software Development, Crystal, Dynamic Systems Development Method, Extreme Programming (XP), Feature-Driven Development (FDD), Pragmatic Programming, and Scrum. This chapter presents the principles that underlie and unite the agile methodologies. Then, 32 practices used in agile methodologies are presented. Finally, three agile methodologies (XP, FDD, and Scrum) are explained. Most often, software development teams select a subset of the agile practices and create their own hybrid software development methodology rather than strictly adhere to all the practices of a predefined agile methodology. Teams that use primarily agile practices are most often small- to medium-sized, colocated teams working on less complex projects."
437.0,Excluded,ec3,Agile software development methodology for medium and large projects,"Extreme programming (XP) is one of the most widely used agile methodologies for software development. It intends to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. Despite the facts that the use of XP offers a number of benefits and it has been a widely used agile methodology, XP does not offer the same benefits when it comes to medium and large software projects. Some of the reasons for this are weak documentation, lack of strong architecture and ignorance to risk awareness during the software development. Owing to the ever-increasing demand of agile approaches, this study addresses the problem of XP's ability to handle medium and large projects. Most of the companies that employ XP as a development methodology for medium and large projects face this problem, which echoes the importance of this problem. To address this problem, in this study XP model is extended in such a way that it equally offers its benefits for medium- and large-scale projects. As an evaluation of the extended XP, three independent industrial case studies are conducted. The case studies are described and results are presented in the study. The results provide evidence that the extended XP can be beneficial for medium and large software development projects."

There is lack of surveys related to agile processes in large web development enterprises in the world and the current state of adoption of agile processes by large enterprises is still unknown. A survey has been conducted in this research based on questionnaire and interviews in five large Jordanian enterprises to examine the process models adopted by these enterprises, the extent to which these enterprises are using agile processes, and finally to examine the problems associated with large web applications' development. The results of this survey showed that there is a weakness in adoption of agile processes in large Jordanian enterprises and the Extreme Programming (XP) is well known agile process by the developers working in these enterprises. According to survey results, we suggested recommendations related to adoption of XP agile process in large enterprises."

Little is known about how team members who are dispersed across different geographical locations, time zones and cultures can build trust while working together in Agile software development projects. Through a Grounded Theory study that involved 55 participants from 38 different software companies in the USA, India and Australia, we investigate the key concerns of distributed teams in Agile software development. We found that trust among members of a distributed team is important for bridging spatial, temporal and socio-cultural distances in order for them to work together as one team.

442.0,Excluded,ec3,Agile software development: a contemporary philosophical perspective,"This paper critically evaluates the use of revolutionary and evolutionary theories of scientific method, respectively those of two prominent 20th century philosophers, Thomas Kuhn and Karl Popper, to account for change in software engineering methodologies. The paper will predominantly assess the extent to which the Agile software community's use of Kuhn's theory of revolutionary scientific change, particularly in Kent Beck's Extreme Programming (XP), is justified. It will be argued that whereas Kuhn's concepts of ""scientific revolutions"" and ""paradigm shift"" can partially explain the large-scale, radical change from ""traditional"" software methodologies to Agile ones, Popper's critical rationalism seems better suited to the small-scale, piecemeal methodological approach of Agile methodologies. The ethical implications to software engineering of Kuhn's and Popper's theories, as well as the work of the Peopleware authors and the architect, Christopher Alexander, will be discussed. Finally, the ideas of the Frankfurt School will be used to broaden the Popper versus Kuhn debate. A critical reflection on the soundness of applying theories of scientific methodology to the practice of software engineering concludes this paper."

Agile methodologies (AM) have emerged to challenge traditional SD and overcome their limitations. Yet empirical research into AM is sparse. This paper develops and tests a research model that hypothesizes the effects of five characteristics of agile systems development (iterative development; continuous integration; test-driven design; feedback; and collective ownership) on two dependent stakeholder satisfaction measures, namely stakeholder satisfaction with the development process and with the development outcome. An empirical study of 59 South African development projects (using self reported data) provided support for all hypothesized relationships and generally supports the efficacy of AM. Iteration and integration together with collective ownership have the strongest effects on the dependent satisfaction measures."
446.0,Excluded,ec3,Agile Team Perceptions of Productivity Factors,"In this paper, we investigate agile team perceptions of factors impacting their productivity. Within this overall goal, we also investigate which productivity concept was adopted by the agile teams studied. We here conducted two case studies in the industry and analyzed data from two projects that we followed for six months. From the perspective of agile team members, the three most perceived factors impacting on their productivity were appropriate team composition and allocation, external dependencies, and staff turnover. Teams also mentioned pair programming and collocation as agile practices that impact productivity. As a secondary finding, most team members did not share the same understanding of the concept of productivity. While some known factors still impact agile team productivity, new factors emerged from the interviews as potential productivity factors impacting agile teams."
447.0,Excluded,ec3,Agile techniques to avoid firefighting at a start-up,"This paper documents the creation and evolution of the (modified) agile methodology implemented at Sabrix, Inc., a start-up enterprise-class software company. The company was delivering alpha quality software to early adopter customers on a weekly basis, using urgency as the primary driver for product development. New features and bug fixes were completed in a manner similar to a soccer game between two teams of five-year-olds, with everyone on the team chasing down the latest emergency. This paper discusses the agile software development discipline that enabled Sabrix to evolve from that chaotic environment to the point where the company was balancing both urgency and importance to drive product direction. This discipline enabled the company to actually deliver a ""Release"", and move forward into a new product architecture."

The analysis presented in this paper allows us to answer research questions like: what is agile testing used for, what types of studies on agile testing have been published, what problems do people have when performing agile testing, and what benefits do these publications offer? We additionally explore topics such as: who are the major authors in this field, in which countries do these authors work, what tools are mentioned, and is the field driven by academics, practitioners, or collaborations?

However, the terminology used to describe the field - as well as the evidence in existing literature - is largely inconsistent. In order to better structure our understanding of the field and to guide future work, we conducted a systematic mapping of agile testing. We investigated five research questions: which authors are most active in agile testing; what is agile testing used for; what types of paper tend to be published in this field; how do practitioners and academics contribute to research in this field; and what tools are used to conduct agile testing? Of particular interest is our investigation into the source of these publications, which indicates that academics and practitioners focus on different types of publication and, disturbingly, that the number of practitioner papers in the sources we searched is strongly down since 2010."

As the emphasis of user experience work has inherently been on the early phases before starting the development, it also needs to be adapted to the Agile way of working. To improve the current practices in Agile user experience work, we determined the present state of a multi-continental software development organization that already had a functioning user experience team. In this paper, we describe the most prevalent issues regarding the interaction of user experience design and software development activities, and suggest improvements to fix those. Most of the observed problems were related to communication issues and to the service mode of the user experience team. The user experience team was operating between management and development organizations trying to adapt to the dissimilar practices of both the disciplines."

The goal of this SIG is to draw upon the shared experience of these practitioners to uncover the best practices for agile user-centered design to facilitate optimal product development."
455.0,Included,included,Agile versus CMMI - process template selection and integration with microsoft team foundation server,"Increasingly many software development organizations must pursue at least a level 3 CMMI certification to compete in the marketplace. Not all software organizations are under this constraint, but the CMMI model offers benefit beyond just a marketing advantage. Agile methods have taken hold in many of the same organizations that stand to gain benefit from CMMI. CMMI adds some stress to the Agile approach by nature of more detailed planning and tracking. Microsoft and other software development organizations have endeavored to automate the more tedious aspects of CMMI, thus making it easier to support agile approaches within more rigid frameworks. The Microsoft Solutions Framework (MSF) initially founded on Microsoft software best practices observed internally and externally has expanded to integrate automated software configuration for team projects. The Team Foundation Server (TFS) product leverages MSF and supports both CMMI and Agile as process templates and provides tools around these templates to automate the use of either approach. In this paper, we explore how Microsoft has integrated these approaches into TFS, the rationale and implications for selecting one approach over another and how agile practices can be integrated into a CMMI framework."

To answer this question, this paper presents an extensive case study that compares agile (Scrum, XP, etc.) vs. structured (RUP, waterfall) processes to determine if the choice of process impacts aspects such as the overall success and economic savings of distributed projects, the motivation of the development teams, the amount of communication required during development, and the emergence of critical issues. The case study includes data from 66 projects developed in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. The results show no significant difference between the outcome of projects following agile processes and structured processes, suggesting that agile and structured processes can be equally effective for globally distributed development. The paper also discusses several qualitative aspects of distributed software development such as the advantages of nearshore vs. offshore, the preferred communication patterns, and the effects on project quality."
457.0,Excluded,ec3,Agile way of BI implementation,"The rapidly changing IT economy has influenced the Business Intelligence (BI) systems to look at innovative ways to be equally fast and flexible. There is a need to be more intuitive and quick in implementation so as to adapt to the changing environment. One of the ways by which organizations can achieve these goals is by using Agile based BI development models. There are many components in a successful BI solution which include data integration, analytics, data quality, metadata management, enterprise data warehouse, dashboards and so on. Each of these components are critical for an organization, and stakeholders are ready to invest in these. The only issue is how quickly we can provide these solutions and how flexible these solutions are with the changing demands. Traditionally, we have been using the waterfall SDLC model for BI implementations which encourages getting requirements clarity in the initial phases of the projects and having distinct deliverables for each phase. With time the approach has been customized and enhanced to `iterative waterfall approach' where a chunk of requirements is implemented in one SDLC cycle. Though this approach has been successful in the past, the BI practitioners recognize that business requirements are not static and we must be able to effectively mould the deliverables based on changing requirements. Hence, we cannot continue with the Waterfall (or Iterative waterfall) project management approach that is neither fast nor flexible. Applying the concepts of agile development to BI is the intuitive way forward. The aim of this paper is to provide a background on agile project management &amp; development techniques, and suggest some guidelines and best practices which can help in successful Agile BI implementations."

Market forces caused new technology innovations, and traditional outsourcing strategies failed to deliver on the new vision. The decision to develop these new product capabilities in-house created the need for software competency that didn't currently exist. Cost of software was historically considered “free” because it was very simple and ROI was far less than a year. Now, software is driving many business decisions and strategies. And today the software group has about 40 people. Starting a software competency in an existing business with material non-software businesses is not straightforward. Sustaining this competency requires successfully addressing challenges with the entire organization and is a long-term effort.

New software engineering insights based on interaction design and iterative, agile processes for the development help in building systems from a more outside-in perspective. Based on two case studies from large European projects on integrated assessment this switch from applying old to applying new principles will be described, and its effects discussed. Elements were taken from interaction design: personas, story boards, mock-ups, focus groups and focus tasks. These were mixed with an iterative and incremental development process, using agile elements such as: daily stand-ups, user stories, planning games, Test Driven Development and continuous integration. The resulting process was used for the development of the two systems (SIAT and SEAMLESS-IF) for integrated assessment, giving them a more user-oriented focus than what would have resulted from following the old principles."

465.0,Excluded,ec3,Agility in the avionics software world,"This paper 1 takes a look at how XP and other agile practices can improve a software process for the development of avionics software. Developers of mission critical airborne software are heavily constrained by the RTCA DO-178B regulations [8]. These regulations impose strict rules regarding traceability and documentation that make it extremely hard to employ an iterative software development process. In particular, the extra validation overhead increases the time spent on small iteration cycles (for example, a bug-fix) to several weeks. Currently, this sector is also pressed to switch to a more agile, customer driven approach. In this paper we investigate how to speed up development and cope with changing requirements using agile techniques. The research was carried out in cooperation with Barco, a major Belgian avionics equipment supplier. We explain why certain agile techniques have less effect as the project progresses. We point out the stadia in which each XP practice is beneficial and where XP practices might cause a slowdown. Â© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006."

Software process improvement (SPI) provides the first step in the move towards software quality, and assessments are a vital part of this process. Unfortunately, software process assessments are often expensive and time consuming. Additionally, they often provide companies with a long list of issues without providing realistic suggestions. The goal of this paper is to describe a new low-overhead assessment method that has been designed specifically for small-to-medium-sized (SMEs) organisations wishing to be automotive software suppliers.

The sensor suite consists of a variety of imaging sensors, including a color TV camera and an uncooled thermal infrared camera. Two different ranging sensors are also part of the sensor suite: an optical radar scanner and a millimeter wave radar system. Both radar systems are equipped with specialized software for experimental modes, such as terrain mapping and ground scanning.

Multiple system configurations and behaviours were evaluated. An evaluation of the system showed that, while there was no significant change in the proportion of build breakages, the overall number of builds increased substantially, and the duration of broken builds decreased. Team members also reported an increased sense of awareness of, and responsibility for, broken builds and some noted the system dramatically changed their perception of the build process making them more cognisant of broken builds."
473.0,Excluded,ec7,An \{IT\} perspective on integrated environmental modelling: The \{SIAT\} case,"Policy makers have a growing interest in integrated assessments of policies. The Integrated Assessment Modelling (IAM) community is reacting to this interest by extending the application of model development from pure scientific analysis towards application in decision making or policy context by giving tools a higher capability for analysis targeted at non-experts, but intelligent users. Many parties are involved in the construction of such tools including modellers, domain experts and tool users, resulting in as many views on the proposed tool. During tool development research continues which leads to advanced understanding of the system and may alter early specifications. Accumulation of changes to the initial design obscures the design, usually vastly increasing the number of defects in the software. The software engineering community uses concepts, methods and practices to deal with ambiguous specifications, changing requirements and incompletely conceived visions, and to design and develop maintainable/extensible quality software. The aim of this paper is to introduce modellers to software engineering concepts and methods which have the potential to improve model and tool development using experiences from the development of the Sustainability Impact Assessment Tool. These range from choosing a software development methodology for planning activities and coordinating people, technical design principles impacting maintainability, quality and reusability of the software to prototyping and user involvement. It is argued that adaptive development methods seem to best fit research projects, that typically have unclear upfront and changing requirements. The break-down of a system into elements that overlap as little as possible in features and behaviour helps to divide the work across teams and to achieve a modular and flexible system. However, this must be accompanied by proper automated testing methods and automated continuous integration of the elements. Prototypes, screen sketches and mock-ups are useful to align the different views, build a shared vision of required functionality and to match expectations."

Based on a user-collaborated QoS-aware middleware, SOA systems can dynamically adjust their optimal fault tolerance configurations to achieve optimal service reliability as well as good overall performance. Both the subjective user requirements and the objective system performance of the Web services are considered in our adaptive fault tolerance strategy. Experiments are conducted to illustrate the advantages of the proposed adaptive fault tolerance strategy. Performance and effectiveness comparisons of the proposed adaptive fault tolerance strategy and various traditional fault tolerance strategies are also provided."
475.0,Excluded,ec7,An adaptive security model using agent-oriented \{MDA\},"Model-driven architecture (MDA) supports model-centred software development via successive model transformation. In MDA, the reusability of models is improved as well as the traceability of requirements. Agent-oriented model-driven architecture (AMDA) associates adaptive agents with a business-oriented interaction model and lets agents dynamically interpret their behaviour from the continuously maintained model via which the current business needs are deployed at runtime. The continuous re-interpretation rather than discrete re-transformation of models means immediate requirements deployment after re-configuration, no system down time being required to affect changes and results in a development process that is oriented to business experts rather than developers. Adopting the adaptive agent model, an \{AMDA\} paradigm, we put forward a securityâ€“aware model-driven mechanism by using an extension of the role-based access control (RBAC) model. For this purpose, the concept of agent role proposed in agent-oriented software engineering (AOSE) is integrated with the one proposed in RBAC. Agent duties are specified in an interaction model and describe the roles that agents can play to fulfil their functional responsibilities. Agent rights are specified in a security policy rule model attached to the interaction model and describe constraints upon agent capabilities caused by their associated social roles. The role-based interaction and policy-driven model incorporates both agent rights and duties. Hence, functional requirements and non-functional security constraint requirements are put together, related by the concept of role. Consequently, agents can continuously use the re-configurable model to play their roles in order to fulfil their responsibilities, and at the same time respect the security constraints. The major contribution from the approach is a method for building adaptive and secure MAS, following model-driven architecture. The approach is illustrated with an actual British railway management system."

We followed XP approach during development of new features. This approach allowed us not only to contribute to the original Open Source project, helping it to become increasingly mature, but also to evaluate in a quantitative manner the effort devoted to the international project, to the national context and to the specific health care organization."
479.0,Included,included,An agile approach for software product lines scoping,"Agile principles and practices have been applied in some Software Product Lines (SPL) activities such as scoping, requirements, tests, and architecture to address benefits from both paradigms. Agile principles and practices can be appropriate to scenarios with frequent changes decreasing effort, improving the communication and collaboration among the stakeholders, and adapting easier to volatilities of technology, domain, or requirements when performing the SPL activities. This paper describes an initial approach for SPL scoping combined with Agile principles and practices."
480.0,Included,included,An agile approach to requirement specification,"This experience report is about how one project in Norway made an agile approach to specifying software requirements for a new intranet. Rather than spending months on trying to detail all requirements and aspects of the solution, the team spent a few weeks specifying a prioritized list of high-level requirements. Further details will emerge by face-to-face communication through the iterations of the project quickly turning in to valuable working software for the customer."

482.0,Excluded,ec3,An agile development methodology applied to embedded control software under stringent hardware constraints,"In recent years, discrete control systems play an important role in the development and advancement of modern civilization and technology. Practically every aspect of our life is affected by some type of control systems. This kind of system maybe classified as an embedded real-time system and requires rigorous methodologies to develop the software that is under stringent hardware constraints. Therefore, the proposed development methodology adapts agile principles and patterns in order to build embedded control systems focusing on the issues related to the system's constraints and safety. Strong unit testing is the foundation of the proposed methodology for ensuring timeliness and correctness. Moreover, platform-based design approach is used to balance costs and time-to-market in view of performance and functionality constraints. We conclude that the proposed methodology reduces significantly the design time and cost as well as leads to better software modularity and reliability."

By maturing our agile disciplines, we feel we will not only improve the performance of our agile teams, which will ultimately benefit our agile development practices regardless of our appraisal rating, but will also lead to our being appraised at CML 5. This experience report describes the steps we are taking to improve our agile development disciplines, which we believe will lead to our being appraised at CML 5."
484.0,Included,included,An agile hypertext design methodology,"Customers are driving down lead times for software, especially for Web applications, to only a few months. While a number of hypertext design models exist, they do not address the issue of the requirements and analysis process that normally feeds the design process. In this paper we present an agile approach to developing hypertext applications, which focuses on the requirements and analysis stages, something that is largely ignored in current methodologies."
485.0,Excluded,ec6,An agile method for teaching agile in business schools,"Abstract The aim of this paper is to describe, evaluate and discuss a new method for teaching agile project management and similar subjects in higher education. Agile is not only a subject domain in this work, the teaching method itself is based on Scrum, a popular agile methodology mostly used in software development projects. The method is supported by wikis, a natural platform for simulation of software development environments. The findings from the evaluation indicate that the method enables the creation of â€œsignificant learningâ€�, which prepares students for life-long learning and increases their employability. However, the knowledge gains, resulting from wiki interactions are found to be more quantitative than qualitative. The results also imply that despite the active promotion of agile values of communication and feedback, issues regarding the teamwork are still emerging. The engagement of the teacher in the learning and teaching process was discovered to be a motivational factor for the team cohesion. This paper could be of interest to anyone planning to teach agile in the higher education settings, but also to a wider academic community interested in applying agile methods in their own teaching practice."
486.0,Included,included,An agile request for proposal (RFP) process,"The request for proposal (RFP) process can be agile and efficient. At a high level, the key to achieving this is to specify requirements just in time and containing just enough detail. We apply the following XP practices and concepts to the RFP process: acceptance tests, business value, iterative and incremental delivery, on-site customer, pair development, planning game, spike, story, velocity, and yesterday's weather. In addition, the following concepts are combined with those from XP to achieve maximal benefit: user-goal use case, context diagram, level of detail, and decision tree. The contributions to the agile community are two-fold: describing a practical application of XP concepts to a nonprogramming project; and making use case style requirements processes more agile."

The results obtained from this analysis indicate that Scrum does not meet all the required practices present in such process areas. We point out what is missing in Scrum to fully comply with these areas and propose solutions for it.
488.0,Excluded,ec3,An Application of Focus Theory to Project Management Processes,"This article presents the findings of an exploratory study of the degree to which Focus Theory, a general theory about group productivity, can be used to improve the productivity of project management activities. Guided by the theory and the principles of collaboration engineering, we developed a collaborative template for project progress status reporting. We evaluated the template in both face-to-face and distributed group interactions. The study indicated that a collaborative template helped structure status reporting activity and provided a permanent record of project status for future reference. As a result, it was efficient and effective for team leaders to prepare topics for project status meetings by using the template. The meetings became focused on topics outlined on the template and meeting participants commented that the meeting record helped them keep track of what had been either accomplished or decided. The major limitation observed for use of the template was that, when used in distributed and synchronous interactions, it needed to be augmented by voice communication because communication in text-only format, as provided by the template, was too time-consuming. We discuss implications of the research outcomes with respect to the usefulness and limitations of Focus Theory."

Our assumption was that most business rules would have complex structure and their interpretation would require new facts to be generated and analyzed, similarly as it happens in expert systems. Another assumption was that the rules would be stored in tables of relational database. Our experience gained so far indicates that the idea of the compilation of possibilities given by \{SQL\} language and interface engine based on if-then type rules together with the ability of new facts generation is right."
490.0,Excluded,ec3,An approach for concurrent evaluation of technical and social aspects of software development methodologies,The paper presents an approach for evaluation of software development methodologies (SDM) that considers the aspects of a SDMâ€™s social adoption and technical efficiency. It builds on existing evaluation models used in the field of SDM. Case study approach was used to validate the model in four software development organisations. In all four cases the management confirmed that the model provided valuable new insights into adoption and efficiency of the companiesâ€™ SDM.
491.0,Included,included,An approach to applying SOFL for agile process and its application in developing a test support tool,"Structured Object-Oriented Formal Language (SOFL) is a representative formal engineering method for software development. It offers a three-step specification approach to constructing formal specifications, and specification-based inspection and testing for verification and validation. In this paper, we describe a novel approach to applying the SOFL method to achieve agile development process. This approach results from our experience in several collaboration projects with industry, and aims to strike a balance between the fast delivery of software product and the assurance of its quality. We have tested the approach in developing a prototype test support tool."
492.0,Excluded,ec7,An Approach to Carry Out Consistency Analysis on Requirements: Validating and Tracking Requirements through a Configuration Structure,"Requirements management and traceability have always been one of grand challenges in software development area. Studies reveal that 30-40% of software defects can be traced to gaps or errors in requirements Although several models and techniques have been defined to optimize the requirements process, ensuring alignment and consistency of elicited requirements continues to be a challenge. All software engineering standards and methodologies recognize the importance of maintaining relationships among the software elements for traceability. We have leveraged the structured relationships among the requirement elements to come up with an approach to systematically carry out consistency analysis of requirements for software systems. The framework has multiple models: a multi layered requirement model, a configuration structure to link and track the requirement items, a consistency analysis method to identify the inconsistencies in the requirements and a consistency index computation to indicate the level of consistency in overall requirements of the software system. This approach helps to validate the requirements from both completeness and correctness perspectives and also check their consistency in forward and backward directions. The paper outlines the framework, describes the encompassing models and the implementation details from pilot of the framework to an industry case study along with results."
493.0,Excluded,ec7,An approach to enterprise process dynamic modeling supporting enterprise process evolution,"This study presents an evolutionary approach to support dynamic enterprise modeling for enterprise process cooperative scheduling and management. In this paper, an evolutionary dynamic enterprise process modeling method was proposed from the concepts of enterprise process evolution to zero-time enterprise modeling and layered complex enterprise modeling. Based on an autonomous agent development platform, an agent-based enterprise collaborative modeling environment has been implemented by integrating several software resource agents that wrap main function modules of EPMS. Scheduling strategies, algorithms, and process-driven cooperative scheduling mechanism are also discussed."
494.0,Excluded,ec3,An approach to model the return on investment of organization-wide improvement projects using the concept of external effects,"Return on Investment in the software world is affected by many aspects addressing different targets. Currently it seems that no appropriate method to catch all relevant aspects of investments that affect not a single project's success, but the capabilities and potentialities of the organization that delivers software in different projects is available. In this paper, we present an approach to model interrelations between the different effects of such investments. It is based on the definition of four criteria by which ""capability"" of an organization developing software can be measured. For each of the four factors, we suggest a couple of indicators to determine the organization's level of maturity in that aspect. Furthermore, we sketch a method to integrate the anticipated benefits of improvement investments. This analysis is based on the theory of external effects since we believe that investments in one area have implications on the other competencies or aspects of software development capability."
495.0,Excluded,ec3,An approach to test-driven development of conceptual schemas,"Test-Driven Development (TDD) is an extreme programming development method in which a software system is developed in short iterations. In this paper we present the Test-Driven Conceptual Modeling (TDCM) method, which is an application of \{TDD\} for conceptual modeling, and we show how to develop a conceptual schema using it. In TDCM, a system's conceptual schema is incrementally obtained by performing three kinds of tasks: (1) Write a test the system should pass; (2) Change the schema to pass the test; and (3) Refactor the schema to improve its qualities. We also describe an integration approach of \{TDCM\} into a broad set of software development methodologies, including the Unified Process development methodology, the MDD-based approaches, the storytest-driven agile methods and the goal and scenario-oriented requirements engineering methods. We deal with schemas written in UML/OCL, but the \{TDCM\} method could be adapted to the development of schemas in other languages."
497.0,Excluded,ec7,An approach to the software quality management,"This article is devoted to an engineering approach to software quality management. The approach is oriented toward the attainment of the software maturity, which is a key software quality characteristic. A model of quality and a conceptual model for making decisions on software quality management are developed. They are based on methods of specification of quality requirements to the maturity of software components, defect prediction, and systematic quantitative reliability control during software development. A graphical defect prediction model (a Bayesian Belief Network) is presented."
498.0,Excluded,ec3,An architectural model for software testing lesson learned systems,"Context Software testing is a key aspect of software reliability and quality assurance in a context where software development constantly has to overcome mammoth challenges in a continuously changing environment. One of the characteristics of software testing is that it has a large intellectual capital component and can thus benefit from the use of the experience gained from past projects. Software testing can, then, potentially benefit from solutions provided by the knowledge management discipline. There are in fact a number of proposals concerning effective knowledge management related to several software engineering processes. Objective We defend the use of a lesson learned system for software testing. The reason is that such a system is an effective knowledge management resource enabling testers and managers to take advantage of the experience locked away in the brains of the testers. To do this, the experience has to be gathered, disseminated and reused. Method After analyzing the proposals for managing software testing experience, significant weaknesses have been detected in the current systems of this type. The architectural model proposed here for lesson learned systems is designed to try to avoid these weaknesses. This model (i) defines the structure of the software testing lessons learned; (ii) sets up procedures for lesson learned management; and (iii) supports the design of software tools to manage the lessons learned. Results A different approach, based on the management of the lessons learned that software testing engineers gather from everyday experience, with two basic goals: usefulness and applicability. Conclusion The architectural model proposed here lays the groundwork to overcome the obstacles to sharing and reusing experience gained in the software testing and test management. As such, it provides guidance for developing software testing lesson learned systems."
499.0,Excluded,ec7,An architecture-centric approach for goal-driven requirements elicitation,"Software system development typically starts from a requirement specification followed by stepwise refinement of available requirements while transferring them into the system architecture. However, the granularity and the amount of requirements to be elicited for a successful architectural design are not well understood. This paper proposes a process concept to support system development with the help of an architecture-centric approach for goal-driven requirements elicitation. The process focuses on multiple quality dimensions, such as performance, reliability and scalability, and at the same time shall reduce costs and risks through early decision evaluation. The main contribution of this paper is a novel process where not only requirements can drive architectural design, but also architectural design can selectively drive requirement elicitation with the help of hypotheses connected to the selected architectural solutions. The paper concludes with a discussion on its possible empirical validation."
500.0,Excluded,ec7,An aspect-oriented UML tool for software development with early aspects,Aspect-oriented Component Engineering uses early aspects to better categorize and reason about provided and required services of individual components in software systems. Our earlier work on AOCE demonstrated an increase in the reusability and understandability of software components and systems via its usage of early requirements and design-phase aspects but lacked adequate tool support. We describe a novel design tool called Aspect-Oriented UML (AO-UML) that can be used to efficiently capture and manage early aspects for software development using the Aspect-oriented Component Engineering methodology. The key benefits of our tool are its use throughout the development lifecycle and its ability to support and take advantage of Aspect-Oriented Component Engineering's features and capabilities.
501.0,Included,included,An audit model for ISO 9001 traceability requirements in agile-XP environments,"Software organizations that develop their software products using the agile software processes such as Extreme Programming (XP) face a number of challenges in their effort to demonstrate that their process activities conform to ISO 9001 requirements, a major one being product traceability: software organizations must provide evidence of ISO 9001 conformity, and they need to develop their own procedures, tools, and methodologies to do so. This paper proposes an auditing model for ISO 9001 traceability requirements that is applicable in agile (XP) environments. The design of our model is based on evaluation theory, and includes the use of several auditing ""yardsticks"" derived from the principles of engineering design, the SWEBOK Guide, and the CMMI-DEV guidelines for requirement management and traceability for each yardstick. Finally, five approaches for agile-XP traceability approaches are audited based on the proposed audit model. Â© 2013 ACADEMY PUBLISHER."
502.0,Excluded,ec3,An automated approach for acceptance web test case modeling and executing,"This paper proposes an approach for modeling and executing acceptance web test cases and describes a suite of tools to support it. The main objective is to assist the use of Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD) in web applications by providing mechanisms to support customer-developer communication and by helping test case creation. Initially, the set of web pages and relations (links) associated with a user story is modeled. Functional test possibilities involving these relations are automatically summarized in a graph, being each path of the graph a user story testing scenario. Once a testing scenario is accepted by the customer, a testing script is automatically created. A web testing framework then executes the script, triggering the ATDD process.

503.0,Excluded,ec3,An efficient algorithm to solve a multi-objective robust aggregate production planning in an uncertain environment,"Risk is inherent in most economic activities. This is especially true of production activities where results of decisions made today may have many possible different outcomes depending on future events. Since companies cannot usually protect themselves completely against risk, they have to manage it. In this paper, we present a multi-objective model to deal with a multi-period multi-product multi-site aggregate production planning problem for a medium-term planning horizon under uncertainty. The first objective function attempts to minimize sum of the expected value and the variability of total costs with reference to inventory levels, regular, overtime and subcontracting levels, backordering levels, and labor, machine and warehouse capacities. The second objective function highlighted the concept of customer service level through minimizing the expected value of maximum shortages among all customers’ zones from which the variability of that is conducted. The last objective function aims to maximize workers productivity, a weighted average of productivity levels in all factories and in all periods which is weighted by the number of k-level labors. Then, we use an efficient algorithm that is a combination of an augmented ε-constraint method and genetic algorithm to solve our proposed model. The results demonstrate the practicability of the proposed multi-objective stochastic model as well as the proposed algorithm."
504.0,Excluded,ec3,An embedded system for knowledge-based cost evaluation of molded parts,"In this paper, we present an embedded knowledge-base system and apply it to estimate the manufacturing cost of molded parts. This system is designed on a tiny single board computer, called the â€œGumstixâ„¢â€�, which is an inexpensive and high-performance miniaturized platform. It consists of a knowledge-base, knowledge processing units and server service unit for user interactions, all of which are implemented on the Gumstix computer. A \{CAD\} server is provided for the interaction with commercial \{CAD\} software and all operations with users are performed via a web browser. This hardware and software structure features a realization of the Plug &amp; Play concept and provides low-cost, low-power consumption, high-performance and high portability of complex engineering software. The system is demonstrated with cost estimation of molded parts. A knowledge set for the injection molding process is formalized in \{XML\} and a knowledge-base is constructed. The system is tested with examples, which illustrate the capability of our system for engineering applications."
505.0,Excluded,ec4,An empirical characterization of scientific software development projects according to the Boehm and Turner model: A progress report,"A number of recent studies reported on the success of applying agile methods in scientific software development projects. These studies found that agile methods are well suited to the exploratory, iterative, and collaborative nature of scientific inquiry. However, these findings might not be applicable in all situations pertaining to scientific software development projects. In addition, they only constitute a subset of the important factors while deciding which development methods and practices should be adopted. Therefore, it becomes important to conduct further research before making recommendations regarding the adoption of certain development methods and practices in this domain. In this progress report, we discuss our on-going research that will empirically study the characteristics of various scientific software development projects according to a model suggested by Boehm and Turner. We plan to conduct interviews and collect data from various scientific software development projects in the Baltimore-Washington area. We expect that our qualitative results will increase our understanding of the characteristics in those projects favoring plan-driven approaches or agile methods, and the needs and conditions associated with those characteristics. Our research provides guidance to scientific software developers by enhancing their capacity to evaluate and understand their own project characteristics and select effective software practices. As a long-term benefit in the same direction, our qualitative results will generate a set of hypotheses that can be tested in different project environments to better understand and categorize scientific software development projects. Consequently, in the future, more generalizable and actionable recommendations can be made for scientific software development projects."
506.0,Excluded,ec3,An empirical comparison between pair development and software inspection in Thailand,"Although pair programming and software inspection have the common aim of minimizing the defects of the software product, each practice has its strengths and weaknesses. We need to understand their costs and benefits under given conditions to be able to select a practice to execute in a development project. The objective of this study is to compare the commonalities and differences between pair development and software inspection as verification techniques in Thailand. One classroom experiment and one industry experiment were conducted. The development effort and effect of quality were investigated with some additional calendar time comparisons. The classroom results showed that average development effort of the pair development group was 24% less than inspection group with the improved product quality. The industry experiment showed pair development to have about 4% more effort but about 40% fewer major defects. In addition, the impacts of cultural differences to the adoption of pair programming or software inspection in Thailand are discussed."

The starting point is given by a study of the literature to obtain both an initial model of testability and existing object-oriented metrics related to testability. Subsequently, these metrics are evaluated by means of five case studies of commercial and open source Java systems for which \{JUnit\} test cases exist. The goal of this paper is to identify and evaluate a set of metrics that can be used to assess the testability of the classes of a Java system."
509.0,Excluded,ec3,An empirical study of relationships among extreme programming engineering activities,"Extreme programming (XP) is an agile software process that promotes early and quick production of working code. In this paper, we investigated the relationship among three \{XP\} engineering activities: new design, refactoring, and error fix. We found that the more the new design performed to the system the less refactoring and error fix were performed. However, the refactoring and error fix efforts did not seem to be related. We also found that the error fix effort is related to number of days spent on each story, while new design is not. The relationship between the refactoring effort and number of days spent on each story was not conclusive."
510.0,Excluded,ec3,An empirical study of system design instability metric and design evolution in an agile software process,"Software project tracking and project plan adjustment are two important software engineering activities. The class growth shows the design evolution of the software. The System Design Instability (SDI) metric indicates the progress of an object-oriented (OO) project once the project is set in motion. The \{SDI\} metric provides information on project evolution to project managers for possible adjustment to the project plan. The objectives of this paper are to test if the System Design Instability metric can be used to estimate and re-plan software projects in an XP-like agile process and study system design evolution in the Agile software process. We present an empirical study of the class growth and the \{SDI\} metric in two \{OO\} systems, developed using an agile process similar to Extreme Programming (XP). We analyzed the system evolutionary data collected on a daily basis from the two systems. We concluded that: the systems' class growth follows observable trends, the \{SDI\} metric can indicate project progress with certain trends, and the \{SDI\} metric is correlated with \{XP\} activities. In both of the analyzed systems, we observed two consistent jumps in the \{SDI\} metric values in early and late development phases. Part of the results agrees with a previous empirical study in another environment."
511.0,Excluded,ec3,An Empirical Study of the Evolution of an Agile-Developed Software System,"We have analyzed evolution patterns over two and a half years for a system developed using eXtreme Programming. We find that the system shows a smooth pattern of growth overall, that (McCabe) code complexity is low, and that the relative amount of complexity control work (e.g. refactoring) is higher than in other systems we have studied. To interpret these results, we have drawn on qualitative data including the results of an observational study, records of progress and productivity, and comments on our findings from team members."
512.0,Excluded,ec7,An empirical study of the state of the practice and acceptance of model-driven engineering in four industrial cases,"Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) has been promoted for many years as a means for handling the complexity of software development by raising the abstraction level and automating labor-intensive and error-prone tasks. However, there is little empirical evidence of the acceptance of MDE in industry which is the subject of this paper. The goal of this empirical study was to investigate the state of the practice of applying MDE and factors considered as important for its adoption. The subjects were developers of four large companies participating in a research project. The collected data came from multiple sources and covered the results of tool evaluations, interviews, and a survey. Among the factors, we found perceived usefulness, ease of use and the maturity of the tools to be important determinants for the adoption of MDE. We also discuss challenges with adopting MDE and present suggestions on how to succeed with the adoption process."
513.0,Excluded,ec3,An empirical study of using planning poker for user story estimation,"Group estimation of user stories is an important part of extreme programming (XP), used for both planning releases and iterations. Research has shown that although group estimation in many cases is superior to individual estimation, there is still room for improvement. For instance, group estimation performance can be reduced by dominant personalities and anchoring effects. Through the analysis of 101 user story estimates, made by an XP team for release planning, we investigate whether the introduction of the planning poker estimation process improved the estimation ability of the team. The results show that planning poker improved the team's estimation performance in most cases, but that it increased estimation error in the extreme cases"
514.0,Excluded,ec7,An Empirical Study on Project-Specific Traceability Strategies,"Effective requirements traceability supports practitioners in reaching higher project maturity and better product quality. Researchers argue that effective traceability barely happens by chance or through ad-hoc efforts and that traceability should be explicitly defined upfront. However, in a previous study we found that practitioners rarely follow explicit traceability strategies. We were interested in the reason for this discrepancy. Are practitioners able to reach effective traceability without an explicit definition? More specifically, how suitable is requirements traceability that is not strategically planned in supporting a project’s development process. Our interview study involved practitioners from 17 companies. These practitioners were familiar with the development process, the existing traceability and the goals of the project they reported about. For each project, we first modeled a traceability strategy based on the gathered information. Second, we examined and modeled the applied software engineering processes of each project. Thereby, we focused on executed tasks, involved actors, and pursued goals. Finally, we analyzed the quality and suitability of a project’s traceability strategy. We report common problems across the analyzed traceability strategies and their possible causes. The overall quality and mismatch of analyzed traceability suggests that an upfront-defined traceability strategy is indeed required. Furthermore, we show that the decision for or against traceability relations between artifacts requires a detailed understanding of the project’s engineering process and goals; emphasizing the need for a goal-oriented procedure to assess existing and define new traceability strategies."
515.0,Excluded,ec3,An empirical study to design an effective agile project management framework,"The agile methodologies have recently gained a widespread popularity in software development. However, most practitioners still have little knowledge of the effectiveness and efficiency of agile practices over traditional methodologies. The traditional project management process follows the PMBOK (Project Management Book of Knowledge) framework, whereas, the agile project management concentrates on iterative development, collaboration and involvement of the customer. Therefore, the traditional project management process can be improved by incorporating the developments in the agile based methodology. Empirical data about different aspects of agile and traditional software development can be collected through questionnaires from the industry as well as the practitioners. The responses and technical issues that come up in empirical studies can be included in the traditional project management. This paper proposes an agile project management framework with the users' involvement throughout the development, a repository of lessons learned, documentation and self-organizing teams. The proposed framework can be helpful in project planning, execution and monitoring in a more effective and efficient manner."
516.0,Excluded,ec3,An empirically based terminology and taxonomy for global software engineering,"Many organizations nowadays strive for utilization of benefits offered by global software engineering (GSE) and sourcing strategies are thus discussed more often. Since there are so many variations of the attributes associated with global software projects a large amount of new terms has been introduced. The diversity in sourcing jargon however has caused difficulties in determining which term to use in which situation, and thus causing further obstacles to searching and finding relevant research during e.g. systematic literature reviews. The inability of judging the applicability of the research in an industrial context is another important implication on the transferability of research into practice. Thus the need for accurate terminology and definitions for different global sourcing situations emerges as a way for the community to build upon each other’s work and hence making progress more quickly. In this paper we first investigate the state of the use of the GSE jargon concluding that terminology is very diverse (many synonyms used to describe the same phenomena), often confusing (same terms used to describe different phenomena) and occasionally ambiguous (few terms used to describe several phenomena). In order to address the identified problems, we conducted a Delphi-inspired study with ten well-established researchers in GSE and developed an empirically based glossary for the key concepts in global software engineering. We then propose a taxonomy for GSE by categorizing the selected terms based on generalization-specialization relationships and illustrate how the taxonomy can be used to categorize and map existing knowledge. The contribution targets future researchers, who will publish or synthesize further empirical work and practitioners, who are interested in published empirical cases. Therefore this work is expected to make a contribution to the future development of research in the GSE field, and alleviate understandability and transferability of existing and future knowledge into practice."
517.0,Excluded,ec3,An Ethnographic Study of XP Practice,Agile methods are a response to more rigorous and traditional approaches to software development which are perceived to have failed both customers and software development practitioners. eXtreme Programming (XP) is an example agile method and we report on an ethnographic study of XP practice carried out in a small company developing web-based intelligent advertisements. We identify five characterizing themes within XP practice and summarize these findings in terms of XP culture.
518.0,Excluded,ec3,An evaluation of the degree of agility in six agile methods and its applicability for method engineering,"While agile methods are in use in industry, little research has been undertaken into what is meant by agility and how a supposed agile method can be evaluated with regard to its veracity to belong to this category of software development methodological approaches. Here, an analytical framework, called 4-DAT, is developed and applied to six well-known agile methods and, for comparison, two traditional methods. The results indicate the degree of agility to be found in each method, from which a judgement can be made as to whether the appellation of â€œagileâ€� to that method is appropriate. This information is shown to be useful, for example, when constructing a methodology from method fragments (method engineering) and when comparing agile and traditional methods."

These groups provide a tremendous resource for the community at large in terms of job growth and recruitment of new and young IT professionals. They also serve as a barometer to how the industry is doing and as to what subjects should be covered in the curriculum. This is a resource that has been largely untapped by the educational institutions in the Greater Cincinnati Area.

However, more and more itpsilas getting clearer that those pains are not exclusive to the software world, and they are present in whatever projects where change is a constant. In the executive business world today, change is a constant, and be prepared to them is a must. This way, Scrum reveals to be an appropriate framework to be used in executive business teams once they start to work focused on ROI (Return On Investment) and in the business goals, acquire teamwork spirit, making strategy and execution nearer, improve continuously and deliver value quickly. In this work the author will talk about his experience on using Scrum with senior management and how the results supported Scrum promotion for other projects inside the company."
522.0,Excluded,ec3,An experience report on improving constructive alignment in an introduction to programming,"This paper discusses the need for learning activities adhering to the constructive alignment theory in introductions to programming. Problems with widespread instruction methods are used to motivate a new variant of pair programming which reduces the possibilities for students to ""evade"" practicing the very skills pair programming is expected to allow them to hone. We present an example of an exercise integrating the new pedagogy and discuss its initial reception by students."
523.0,Excluded,ec3,An experience report on the incremental adoption and evolution of an SPL in eHealth,"This work presents an experience report on the evolutionary development of a software product line (SPL) in the eHealth domain. The effort was triggered by the concurrent development of two similar products and the ambition to reduce redundant development and quality assurance. The result is a scalable base for a complex, highly adaptable information system. This system is required to be applicable in multiple business domains and diverging environments ranging from large scale hospitals to single practitioner clinics. During this effort we were able to extract the common denominator in the form of core assets from existing applications specific to a medical field. For customisations well defined variation points were developed. Our solution allows for easy implementation of medical documentation requirements compared to tedious development of new applications from scratch. It significantly reduced the necessary development effort and time to market. The resulting core documentation platform can be used for an arbitrary medical field completely eliminating the dependence on the specific customer domain."
524.0,Excluded,ec3,An experience report on the verification of autonomic protocols in the cloud,"Cloud applications are often complex distributed applications composed of multiple software components running on separate virtual machines. Setting up, (re)configuring, and monitoring these applications are complicated tasks because a software application may depend on several remote software and virtual machine configurations. These management tasks involve many complex protocols, which fully automate these tasks while preserving application consistency as well as some key properties. In this article, we present two experiences we had in formally specifying and verifying such protocols. The first one aims at designing a reconfiguration protocol of a component-based platform, intended as the foundation for building robust dynamic systems. The second aims at automating the configuration task of a set of virtual machines running a set of interconnected software components. Both applications are specified using the LNT process algebra and verified using the CADP verification toolbox. The use of formal specification languages and tools was a success. We conclude with a number of lessons we have learned while working on this topic in the last 3 years."

We experimented with a shift from a traditional life-cycle to an agile process during the project, and used video techniques for defining requirements and meeting capture."
526.0,Excluded,ec3,"An Experimental Comparison of Four Unit Test Criteria: Mutation, Edge-Pair, All-Uses and Prime Path Coverage","With recent increased expectations for quality, and the growth of agile processes and test driven development, developers are expected to do more and more effective unit testing. Yet, our knowledge of when to use the various unit level test criteria is incomplete. The paper presents results from a comparison of four unit level software testing criteria. Mutation testing, prime path coverage, edge pair coverage, and all-uses testing were compared on two bases: the number of seeded faults found and the number of tests needed to satisfy the criteria. The comparison used a collection of Java classes taken from various sources and hand-seeded faults. Tests were designed and generated mostly by hand with help from tools that compute test requirements and muJava. The findings are that mutation tests detected more faults and the other three criteria were very similar. The paper also presents a secondary measure, a cost benefit ratio, computed as the number of tests needed to detect each fault. Surprisingly, mutation required the fewest number of tests. The paper also discusses some specific faults that were not found and presents analysis for why not."
528.0,Excluded,ec3,An experimental investigation of personality types impact on pair effectiveness in pair programming,"In this paper, pair programming is empirically investigated from the perspective of developer personalities and temperaments and how they affect pair effectiveness. A controlled experiment was conducted to investigate the impact of developer personalities and temperaments on communication, pair performance and pair viability-collaboration. The experiment involved 70 undergraduate students and the objective was to compare pairs of heterogeneous developer personalities and temperaments with pairs of homogeneous personalities and temperaments, in terms of pair effectiveness. Pair effectiveness is expressed in terms of pair performance, measured by communication, velocity, design correctness and passed acceptance tests, and pair collaboration-viability measured by developers’ satisfaction, knowledge acquisition and participation. The results have shown that there is important difference between the two groups, indicating better communication, pair performance and pair collaboration-viability for the pairs with heterogeneous personalities and temperaments. In order to provide an objective assessment of the differences between the two groups of pairs, a number of statistical tests and stepwise Discriminant Analysis were used."
529.0,Excluded,ec3,An exploration of technical debt,"Context Whilst technical debt is considered to be detrimental to the long term success of software development, it appears to be poorly understood in academic literature. The absence of a clear definition and model for technical debt exacerbates the challenge of its identification and adequate management, thus preventing the realisation of technical debt's utility as a conceptual and technical communication device. Objective To make a critical examination of technical debt and consolidate understanding of the nature of technical debt and its implications for software development. Method An exploratory case study technique that involves multivocal literature review, supplemented by interviews with software practitioners and academics to establish the boundaries of the technical debt phenomenon. Result A key outcome of this research is the creation of a theoretical framework that provides a holistic view of technical debt comprising a set of technical debts dimensions, attributes, precedents and outcomes, as well as the phenomenon itself and a taxonomy that describes and encompasses different forms of the technical debt phenomenon. Conclusion The proposed framework provides a useful approach to understanding the overall phenomenon of technical debt for practical purposes. Future research should incorporate empirical studies to validate heuristics and techniques that will assist practitioners in their management of technical debt."
530.0,Excluded,ec3,"An incident information management framework based on data integration, data mining, and multi-criteria decision making","An effective incident information management system needs to deal with several challenges. It must support heterogeneous distributed incident data, allow decision makers (DMs) to detect anomalies and extract useful knowledge, assist \{DMs\} in evaluating the risks and selecting an appropriate alternative during an incident, and provide differentiated services to satisfy the requirements of different incident management phases. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an incident information management framework that consists of three major components. The first component is a high-level data integration module in which heterogeneous data sources are integrated and presented in a uniform format. The second component is a data mining module that uses data mining methods to identify useful patterns and presents a process to provide differentiated services for pre-incident and post-incident information management. The third component is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) module that utilizes \{MCDM\} methods to assess the current situation, find the satisfactory solutions, and take appropriate responses in a timely manner. To validate the proposed framework, this paper conducts a case study on agrometeorological disasters that occurred in China between 1997 and 2001. The case study demonstrates that the combination of data mining and \{MCDM\} methods can provide objective and comprehensive assessments of incident risks."
531.0,Excluded,ec3,An incremental approach for building accessible and usable web applications,"Building accessible Web applications is difficult, moreover considering the fact that they are constantly evolving. To make matters more critical, an application which conforms to the well-known W3C accessibility standards is not necessarily usable for handicapped persons. In fact, the user experience, when accessing a complex Web application, using for example screen readers, tends to be far from friendly. In this paper we present an approach to safely transform Web applications into usable and accessible ones. The approach is based on an adaptation of the well-known software refactoring technique. We show how to apply accessibility refactorings to improve usability in accessible applications, and how to make the process of obtaining this ""new"" application cost-effective, by adapting an agile development process.

532.0,Included,included,An industrial case of exploiting product line architectures in agile software development,"There has been an increased interest in exploring the ways of integrating agile software development and software product line approaches. Both approaches share several common goals, which provide the motivation for integrating them. However, there has been little empirical research for understanding how these approaches can be integrated in industrial settings. This paper presents the findings from a case study of a software development company that has successfully integrated software product line architecture and agile software development practices. The company's processes are described based on product line and agile practices. The results are expected to provide useful insights into the mechanics of exploiting product line practices in agile software development despite apparent philosophical clashes between the two approaches."
533.0,Excluded,ec7,An Industrial Case Study of the Impact of Domain Ignorance on the Effectiveness of Requirements Idea Generation during Requirements Elicitation,"One of the factors that is supposed to have a significant effect on an individual’s effectiveness during requirements engineering activities is knowledge of the problem being solved by the system to be built, i.e., domain knowledge. Nevertheless, domain knowledge is a double-edged sword. While in-depth domain knowledge facilitates understanding the details of the problem, in-depth domain knowledge can promote falling for tacit assumptions of the domain and overlooking the obvious. On the other hand, lack of domain knowledge can facilitate more innovative out-of-the-domain-box idea generation. This paper describes a case study carried out in industry of the idea generation part of a requirements idea brainstorming session conducted by a team deliberately constructed with four domain experts supplied by the company participating in the case study and with four domain ignorants supplied by the authors. The results support the conclusion that having a team consisting of a mix of domain experts and domain ignorants improves the effectiveness of the idea generation part of requirements idea brainstorming."
534.0,Excluded,ec7,An information system to support the engineering designer,"Engineering companies are currently shifting their focus from selling products to providing services, hence the products’ designers must increasingly consider life-cycle requirements, in addition to conventional design parameters. To identify possible areas of concern, engineers must consider knowledge throughout the life cycle of similar or related products. However, because of the size and distributed nature of a company’s operation, engineers often do not have access to front-line maintenance data. In addition, the large number of documents generated during the design and operation of a product makes it impractical to manually review all documents thoroughly during a task. As a case study, this paper discusses the concept and development of a large hypermedia based Knowledge Desktop that has been developed to support the maintenance and future design of aircraft engines. As part of the development cycle, the performance of the software and its acceptance by the user community has been fully evaluated. The evaluation method considered in this paper focuses on the subjective opinion of the users and measures the ease with which users could retrieve the information required to perform specific tasks."

This paper presents the creativity to collect and classify bibliography on different flavors TCP/IP congestion control during these two decades. We have extracted some core results from the bibliography provided here which are described in the form of tables and diagrams."
536.0,Excluded,ec3,An instructional scaffolding approach to teaching software design,"Students often find introductory computer science courses boring and mechanical, leading many to drop from the major. Educators have suggested that bringing realistic design problems into the introductory courses would increase student retention and better prepare students for the major. However, the design and implementation of a solution to a realistic problem is often nontrivial and can therefore be very stressful to students. By using the pedagogical paradigm of scaffolding, this anxiety can be ameliorated. A prototypical design course is described where students implement solutions to progressively more difficult design problems. The solutions to these initial assignments are then continually refactored and used as the code-base for subsequent assignments and the culminating team project. The social interactions necessary for instructional scaffolding are facilitated by having each final project be unique, but similar enough to allow students to help each other. We describe the framework of assignments used in our course, including the capstone projects in which students develop computer vision-based systems that do things like read dice and poker hands, and sort M&Ms."
537.0,Included,included,An integrated approach for requirement selection and scheduling in software release planning,"It is essential for product software companies to decide which requirements should be included in the next release and to make an appropriate time plan of the development project. Compared to the extensive research done on requirement selection, very little research has been performed on time scheduling. In this paper, we introduce two integer linear programming models that integrate time scheduling into software release planning. Given the resource and precedence constraints, our first model provides a schedule for developing the requirements such that the project duration is minimized. Our second model combines requirement selection and scheduling, so that it not only maximizes revenues but also simultaneously calculates an on-time-delivery project schedule. Since requirement dependencies are essential for scheduling the development process, we present a more detailed analysis of these dependencies. Furthermore, we present two mechanisms that facilitate dynamic adaptation for over-estimation or under-estimation of revenues or processing time, one of which includes the Scrum methodology. Finally, several simulations based on real-life data are performed. The results of these simulations indicate that requirement dependency can significantly influence the requirement selection and the corresponding project plan. Moreover, the model for combined requirement selection and scheduling outperforms the sequential selection and scheduling approach in terms of efficiency and on-time delivery."

The developed framework enables identification of anomalies in the field that cause customer dissatisfaction and performs root cause investigation of the anomalies. It also facilitates identification of the best practices in the field and learning from these best practices to achieve lean and effective service. Association rule mining is used for the anomaly detection and the root cause investigation, while case-based-reasoning in conjunction with text mining is used to learn from the best practices. The integrated system is implemented in a web based distributed architecture and has been tested on real life data."

Today, businesses have accumulated large numbers of online services that run and reside on a variety of environments. Furthermore, they have different workflows and operational support systems that need to interact with their legacy systems. The result has been chaotic and disruptive. We developed a new framework, artifact, and performance model with which to address this problem. A multi-agent e-service system was developed to cope with dynamics and upheaval. We used a customer-centric viewpoint with supply chains both upstream and downstream. An implementation was performed to determine problems in its development. Two simple live case studies were conducted to illustrate the model's feasibility and validity."
540.0,Excluded,ec3,An internationally distributed cloud for science: the cloud-enabled space weather platform,"The purpose of the Cloud-Enabled Space Weather Platform (CESWP) project is to bring the power and flexibility of cloud computing to space weather physicists. The goal is to lower the barriers for the physicists to conduct their science. That is, to make it easier to collaborate with other scientists, develop space weather models, run simulations, produce visualizations and enable provenance. Success of the project is measured by the broad acceptance and use of the platform by the space weather science community. To deliver cloud computing and storage, infrastructure as a service, the project has built an internationally distributed cloud based on Eucalyptus [1]. To provide a graphical user interface for the physicists to interact with we selected the Groovy programming language and the Grails web framework. To construct the software we followed the Scrum agile software development methodology. This paper will report on the motivation and risks of such an undertaking. It will also report on the suitability of Eucalyptus as a cloud framework and the utility of the tools used to build an application on top of it."
541.0,Excluded,ec3,An interpretation of the results of the analysis of pair programming during novices integration in a team,"In this paper we present a study on how Pair Programming (PP) facilitates the introduction of new developers (novices) in a team. Data has been collected non-invasively on how people paired in an industrial team of developers for 10 months; during such time novices joined the team. We focused on spontaneous PP, that is, on PP occurring when developers think it is most effective. Social network analysis techniques are used to analyze developers interactions and infer possible conclusions. It appears that initially PP is used to initiate novices, then it is drastically reduced to be resumed eventually when novices “feel” they have reached a significant level of maturity in the team. These phases are coherent with available works on group development and confirm existing findings on the importance of PP in the introduction of novices in teams, and, more generally, on team dynamics."

While some people consider agile methods the best thing that has happened to software development in recent years, other people view them as a backlash to software engineering and compare them to hacking. The aim of this chapter is to introduce the reader to agile methods allowing him/her to judge whether or not agile methods could be useful in modern software development. The chapter discusses the history behind agile methods as well as the agile manifesto, a statement from the leaders of the agile movement. It looks at what it means to be agile, discusses the role of management, describes and compares some of the more popular agile methods, provides a guide for deciding where an agile approach is applicable, and lists common criticisms. It summarizes empirical studies, anecdotal reports, and lessons learned from applying agile methods and concludes with an analysis of various agile methods. The target audiences for this chapter include practitioners, who will be interested in the discussion of the different methods and their applications, researchers who may want to focus on the empirical studies and lessons learned, and educators looking to teach and learn more about agile methods."

545.0,Excluded,ec3,An Iterative Approach for Development of Safety-Critical Software and Safety,"The benefits ascribed to Agile methods are attractive to software engineers working in the safety-critical software domain. There is limited industrial experience and evidence of successful applications of Agile methods in this domain, however, academic research has identified some of the key challenges of their adoption and application, and has started to present feasibility studies. In this paper, we propose an iterative approach for developing safety-critical software, making two novel contributions. Firstly, we address the notion of up-front design in safety-critical software development, and describe the characteristics fan up-front design that is minimal from the perspective of achieving safety objectives. Secondly, we identify a key difficulty of using iterative development for building safety-critical software, and present a way to develop both a software system and a safety argument iteratively. We also give details of a proof-of-concept example illustrating the use of the approach."
546.0,Excluded,ec7,An MDE approach to software process tailoring,"Defining organizational processes is essential for enhancing maturity. However the best process depends on the particularities of each project. Typically a process engineer defines a specific process for each project in an ad-hoc fashion, which is expensive, unrepeatable and error prone. Trying to deal with this challenge we propose a model-based approach to software process tailoring that generates project specific processes based on the organizational process and the project context. The approach is systematic, repeatable and it does not depend on the people using it. The proposal has been applied for tailoring the Requirements Engineering process of a medium size company. The obtained results were validated by process engineers of the company. Processes obtained using the proposed approach matched the ones used in the company for planned contexts and also they were reasonable for non-expected situations."

However, the standard does not specify how the content or the associated model may be filtered. This paper proposes an MPEG-7 scheme which can be deployed for digital video content modelling and filtering. The proposed scheme, COSMOS-7, produces rich and multi-faceted semantic content models and supports a content-based filtering approach that only analyses content relating directly to the preferred content requirements of the user. We present details of the scheme, front-end systems used for content modelling and filtering and experiences with a number of users."

Creativity and innovativeness are among the most essential attributes of graduates and also of successful entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, or the process of starting a new venture, is one of the main roads to new technological innovations. This paper presents novel models of entrepreneurship education integrated in engineering curricula and geared towards students with entrepreneurial intentions. To expose all students to entrepreneurial ideas and to spark their entrepreneurial spirit, we also developed several entrepreneurship add-on modules for existing disciplines. All these programs have been developed and implemented at S.A.Engineering College, Chennai. Preliminary evaluation results are presented and discussed."
550.0,Excluded,ec3,An Orthogonal Framework for Improving Life Cycle Affordability,"Many approaches to improving system affordability focus on one or two strategies (e,g., automation, outsourcing, repurposing, reuse, process maturity), and miss the opportunity for further improvements. Often, they focus on one phase (e.g., acquisition) at the expense of other factors that increase total ownership cost (TOC). Based on several related research projects, we have developed, applied, and evolved an orthogonal framework of strategies for improving Affordability. The framework includes:â€¢ Get the best from people (Staffing, Teambuilding, Facilities, Kaizen) â€¢ Make tasks more efficient (Tools, Work and Oversight Streamlining, Collaboration Technology) â€¢ Eliminate tasks (Lean and Agile Methods, Automation, Model-Based Product Generation) â€¢ Eliminate scrap and rework (Early Risk and Defect Elimination, Evidence-Based Decision Gates, Modularity around Sources of Change, Evolutionary Development, â€¦) â€¢ Simplify products: \{KISS\} (Risk-Based Prototyping, Value-Based Capability Prioritization, Satisficing vs. Optimizing) â€¢ Reuse components (Domain Engineering, Composable Components and Services, Legacy Repurposing) â€¢ Reduce O&amp;S costs (Automate Tasks, Design for Maintainability, Streamline Supply Chain, Anticipate/Prepare for Change) â€¢ Perform value-based tradespace analysis among the above. The research presented will also summarize the use of calibrated quantitative cost models for reasoning about the strategy elements and their tradeoffs."

Sur la base de la distinction entre lâ€™acceptation opÃ©ratoire et sociale, les auteurs effectuent un panorama des concepts et notions mobilisÃ©s par le paradigme de lâ€™acceptation, pour ensuite le critiquer et proposer de considÃ©rer quâ€™humains et technologies sont reliÃ©s par des interactions si Ã©troites que lâ€™on peut parler de symbiose humain-machine, comme lâ€™avait suggÃ©rÃ© Licklider (1960). La premiÃ¨re partie est consacrÃ©e aux diffÃ©rents aspects ergonomiques de lâ€™acceptation opÃ©ratoire (utilisabilitÃ©, critÃ¨res ergonomiques, modÃ¨les de lâ€™interaction) tandis que la seconde partie Ã©voque les aspects psychosociaux de lâ€™acceptation (modÃ¨le de lâ€™acceptation technologique, thÃ©orie de la satisfaction de lâ€™utilisateur, thÃ©orie de la disconfirmation des attentes, thÃ©orie de lâ€™agilitÃ© organisationnelleâ€¦). Lâ€™exercice de la critique de ces deux orientations amÃ¨ne Ã  considÃ©rer que la technologie nâ€™est pas forcÃ©ment Ã  penser comme un corps Ã©tranger que lâ€™humain doit accepter ou refuser mais plutÃ´t comme une partie de nous-mÃªmes qui se comporte, dâ€™un point de vue mÃ©taphorique, comme un symbiote. Ã€ partir du moment oÃ¹ humains et technologies commencent Ã  former des unitÃ©s cohÃ©rentes et indissociables, la relation entre lâ€™humain, la technologie et lâ€™organisation peut sâ€™apprÃ©hender selon une approche symbiotique qui considÃ¨re quâ€™humains et technologies sont reliÃ©s par des rapports de forte dÃ©pendance. En somme, cet article propose de considÃ©rer quâ€™aujourdâ€™hui, la notion de symbiose est plus Ã  mÃªme dâ€™expliquer la relation de lâ€™humain Ã  la technologie que celle dâ€™acceptation. This article proposes a criticism of the concept of technology acceptance. Starting from a distinction between operational and social acceptance, the authors present an overview of the concepts and notions associated to the paradigm of technology acceptance. Then, they criticize the paradigm and propose the idea that human and technologies are connected by interactions that are so narrow that one can refer to human-machine symbiosis, as Licklider (1960) suggested. The first part of the paper is devoted to the various ergonomic aspects of the operational acceptance (usability, ergonomic criteria, model of the interaction) while the second part addresses the psychosocial aspects of acceptance (Technology Acceptance Model, User Information Satisfaction Theory, Expectancy Disconfirmation Theory, Agile Organizational Developmentâ€¦). The idea behind the authorsâ€™ point of view is that technology must not inevitably be thought of as a foreign thing that the human must accept or refuse. From a metaphorical point of view, technology is more and more part of ourselves and behaves like a symbiont. From the time human and technologies start to form coherent and linked units, the relation between human, technology and organization can be apprehended according to a symbiotic approach which considers that human and technologies are connected by strong dependent relationships. In short, this article proposes to consider that the concept of symbiosis is more capable to explain the relationships of human with technology than the acceptance concept."

554.0,Excluded,ec3,Analysing computer science students' teamwork role adoption in an online self-organised teamwork activity,"Computer Science (CS) professionals are regularly required to work in teams to solve complex problems. Agile software development processes are increasingly popular in organisations as a method for teamwork but the self-organising nature of the method and lack of strictly allocated roles means that graduates need to know how to adopt and transition between roles effectively. While online teamwork makes team processes and behaviours transparent, educators are often confronted by the amount of data and difficulty in how to judge roles and behaviours to provide meaningful feedback to students. Furthermore, assessment of teamwork does not necessarily ignite a need to identify roles and behaviours as feedback is usually based on the product, rather than processes and behaviours. Using Dickinson and McIntyre's teamwork roles, we extend the framework to include explicit behaviours to analyse one class of students' self-organised team interactions in an online discussion space as solved open-ended problems. The collaborative activity did encourage role adoption, however not all students moved fluidly through the roles. Despite the lack of defined roles, one or two students adopted leadership roles, but attempts at leadership were not always successful. We discovered other less-obvious roles were equally important for maintaining and progressing team discussions. In this paper, we discuss the roles that emerged and suggest strategies for encouraging and assessing online teamwork. Our framework may prove to be a guide for others seeking to analyse students' teamwork and provides a guide for what behaviours a teacher might look for in online environments. Our findings support the need to develop tools that provide real-time visual feedback to students and teachers about student behaviour and roles when undertaking teamwork in online spaces."
555.0,Included,included,Analysing requirements in a case study of pairing,"Agile software development methods suggest that sharing tasks between a pair of developers has advantages over letting them work as individuals. This effect has been observed in designing and coding tasks too. However, it is not yet known whether or not pairing on requirements engineering tasks could deliver a similar benefit at an early phase of software projects. Based on first-hand experience in pairing development of the OpenOME tool, we analyse the evolving stakeholder requirements using the i*/Tropos method. Our findings show that sharing tasks of different roles becomes more effective when those roles are played by one stakeholder, possibly due to smaller communication delay at a shorter distance."

The complexity of software systems directly contributes to increased testability efforts. This paper does review of testability and complexity of the software systems at the design level. Object oriented design metrics proposed in earlier research models is modified to analyze in detail the relationship between complexity, testability and different attributes of object oriented software design by predicting class level testability. Estimated results depict that different attributes of object oriented systems may add directly to the complexity of design requiring more testing efforts. The metrics proposed in this paper is further validated on four different software projects. Quantifiable results obtained justify the predicted relationship between object oriented design attributes, complexity and testability."

Objectives We extend existing work on evidence-based software engineering by using the \{EBSE\} process in an industrial case to help an organization to improve its automotive testing process. With this we contribute in (1) providing experiences on using evidence based processes to analyze a real world automotive test process and (2) provide evidence of challenges and related solutions for automotive software testing processes. Methods In this study we perform an in-depth investigation of an automotive test process using an extended \{EBSE\} process including case study research (gain an understanding of practical questions to define a research scope), systematic literature review (identify solutions through systematic literature), and value stream mapping (map out an improved automotive test process based on the current situation and improvement suggestions identified). These are followed by reflections on the \{EBSE\} process used. Results In the first step of the \{EBSE\} process we identified 10 challenge areas with a total of 26 individual challenges. For 15 out of those 26 challenges our domain specific systematic literature review identified solutions. Based on the input from the challenges and the solutions, we created a value stream map of the current and future process. Conclusions Overall, we found that the evidence-based process as presented in this study helps in technology transfer of research results to industry, but at the same time some challenges lie ahead (e.g. scoping systematic reviews to focus more on concrete industry problems, and understanding strategies of conducting \{EBSE\} with respect to effort and quality of the evidence)."

However, their effectiveness in learning agile development principles in particular has not yet been determined, despite the fact that numerous agile development workshops have been held over the years. In this paper, we analyze the effectiveness of agile development workshops through an experiment, and show that one of representative workshops is indeed effective at learning agile principles. Self-study is another commonly used method to learn something new. Therefore, we compare the effectiveness of workshops with that of self-study to better illustrate the effectiveness of agile development workshops. In our experiment, we examine 7 workshop subjects and 8 self-study subjects, and compare their scores on the agile mind check, which is a method used to measure their degree of mastery of agile principles. As a result, we demonstrate the effectiveness of agile development workshops, especially those that simulate actual experiences. We also show that one of workshops is more effective than self-study regarding the agile mind check score."

Their formal specification demands an enormous effort, but once specified there are few approaches and even fewer tools that aid the process engineer to analyze the quality of the process. For the last five years we have aided software companies in specifying their software processes and we have found a series of error patterns that indicate the potential presence of misconceptions or misspecifications. This paper presents these patterns, characterizes the kinds of errors they potentially reveal, and details how errors could be localized within a software process model. To assist process engineers to analyze the quality of their processes, we provide Avispa, a tool that graphically renders different aspects of a process model and highlights potential errors as intuitive and comprehensible indicators. The approach and the supporting tool are illustrated by applying them for analyzing the software process models of three Chilean software companies."

In this work we evaluate to what extent experienced developers change their activities during mentoring activities in Pair Programming (PP) and, in this case, how long this effect can be observed. We compare how the experienced developers use the tools when working with other experts and when with new developers. The results indicate that there is a notable difference in the way the tools are used between the experts working together and the experts mentoring the new developers that have just joined the team. Moreover, over time the difference between pairs of experts and mixed pairs (experts and novices) working together becomes almost unnoticeable."

The issue of interest for this paper is the establishment of standards in the area, specifically the â€˜College of Complex Project Managersâ€™ and their â€˜competency standard for complex project managersâ€™. Both the college and the standard have generated significant interest in the Project Management community. Whilst the need for development of the means to manage complex projects is acknowledged, a critical evaluation show significant flaws in the definition of complex in this case, the process by which the College and its standard have emerged, and the content of the standard. If Project Management is to continue to develop as a profession, it will need an evidence-based approach to the generation of knowledge and standards. The issues raised by the evaluation provide the case for a portfolio of research that extends the existing bodies of knowledge into large-scale complicated (or major) projects. We propose that it would be owned by the practitioner community, rather than focused on one organization. Research questions are proposed that would commence this stream of activity towards an intelligent synthesis of what is required to manage in both complicated and truly complex environments.

580.0,Excluded,ec7,Applying a selection method to choose Quality Attribute Techniques,"AbstractContext Software products have requirements on software quality attributes such as safety and performance. Development teams use various specific techniques to achieve these quality requirements. We call these â€œQuality Attribute Techniquesâ€� (QATs). \{QATs\} are used to identify, analyse and control potential product quality problems. Although \{QATs\} are widely used in practice, there is no systematic approach to represent, select, and integrate them in existing approaches to software process modelling and tailoring. Objective This research aims to provide a systematic approach to better select and integrate \{QATs\} into tailored software process models for projects that develop products with specific product quality requirements. Method A selection method is developed to support the choice of appropriate techniques for any quality attribute, across the lifecycle. The selection method is based on three perspectives: (1) risk management; (2) process integration; and (3) cost/benefit using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). An industry case study is used to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of applying the selection method. Results The case study demonstrates that the selection method provides a more methodological and effective approach to choose \{QATs\} for projects that target a specific quality attribute, compared to the ad hoc selection performed by development teams. Conclusion The proposed selection method can be used to systematically choose \{QATs\} for projects to target specific product qualities throughout the software development lifecycle."

The number of companies applying \{MDE\} is still very limited. Although several case studies and reports have been published on \{MDE\} adoption in large companies, experience reports on small enterprises are still rare, despite the fact that they represent a large part of the software companies ecosystem. In this paper we report on our practical experience in two transfer of technology projects on two small companies. In order to determine the degree of success of these projects we present some factors that have to be taken into account in transfer of technology projects. Then, we assess both projects analyzing these factors and applying some metrics to give hints about the potential productivity gains that \{MDE\} could bring. We also comment on some lessons learned. These experiences suggest that \{MDE\} has the potential to make small companies more competitive, because it enables them to build powerful automation tools at modest cost. We will also present the approach followed to train these companies in MDE, and we contribute the teaching material so that it can be used or adapted by others projects of this nature."
585.0,Excluded,ec3,Applying test-driven code search to the reuse of auxiliary functionality,"Software developers spend considerable effort implementing auxiliary functionality used by the main features of a system (e.g. compressing/decompressing files, encryption/decription of data, scaling/rotating images). With the increasing amount of open source code available on the Internet, time and effort can be saved by reusing these utilities through informal practices of code search and reuse. However, when this type of reuse is performed in an ad hoc manner, it can be tedious and error-prone: code results have to be manually inspected and extracted into the workspace. In this paper we introduce the use of test cases as an interface for automating code search and reuse and evaluate its applicability and performance in the reuse of auxiliary functionality. We call our approach Test-Driven Code Search (TDCS). Test cases serve two purposes: (1) they define the behavior of the desired functionality to be searched; and (2) they test the matching results for suitability in the local context. We present CodeGenie, an Eclipse plugin that performs TDCS using a code search engine called Sourcerer. Our evaluation presents evidence of the applicability and good performance of TDCS in the reuse of auxiliary functionality."

587.0,Excluded,ec3,Applying theory of reasoned action in the context of software development practices: insights into team intention and behavior," Many theories in health care and business administration seek answers to the fundamental question of why people behave the way they do. The Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) is a theory that focuses on a person's intention to behave a certain way. An intention is a plan or a likelihood that someone will behave in a particular way in specific situations and driven by what is believed -- whether or not they actually do so. Belief is a state of mind that embodies trust and confidence in something. In this context, actions are driven by what is believed, by what is assumed to be true about the world. Objective: Our aim is to study and characterize a belief system by applying TRA to agile software project teams in terms of origins, sources and impacts of beliefs on self-management development practices. Method: An ethnographic case study was conducted. A set of interviews and observations on origins and impacts of beliefs in self-management practices was conducted over years with professionals from different project teams. Results: The results showed the strong influence of past experiences and organizational contexts on self-management practices of agile teams and pointed out some key issues. Thus, this study contribute to an improved understanding on how to apply behavioral theories to study software practices. Conclusion: This study showed that ethnographic methods are quite useful to understand software practice. The study also demonstrated that it is possible to capture and represent a belief system in a software project context."

589.0,Included,included,Approximation of \{COSMIC\} functional size to support early effort estimation in Agile,"The demands in the software industry of estimating development effort in the early phases of development are met by measuring software size from user requirements. A large number of companies have adapted themselves with Agile processes, which, although, promise rapid software development, pose a huge burden on the development teams for continual decision making and expert judgement, when estimating the size of the software components to be developed at each iteration. COSMIC, on the other hand, is an ISO/IEC international standard that presents an objective method of measuring the functional size of the software from user requirements. However, its measurement process is not compatible with Agile processes, as \{COSMIC\} requires user requirements to be formalised and decomposed at a level of granularity where external interactions with the system are visible to the human measurer. This time-consuming task is avoided by agile processes, leaving it with the only option of quick subjective judgement by human measurers for size measurement that often tends to be erroneous. In this article, we address these issues by presenting an approach to approximate \{COSMIC\} functional size from informally written textual requirements demonstrating its applicability in popular agile processes. We also discuss the results of a preliminary experiment studying the feasibility of automating our approach using supervised text mining."

The case study shows several interesting results. The process of managing architectural changes as well as the information the architects maintain and update is surprisingly similar between the two companies, despite that one has a strong line organisation and the other a strong project organisation. The architecting process found does not differ from what can be seen in other business domains. What does differ is that the architects studied see themselves interacting much more with other stakeholders than architects in general. The actual architectures are based on similar technology, e.g. CAN, but the network topology, S/W deployment and interfaces are totally different. The results indicate how the companyâ€™s different core values influence the architects when defining and maintaining the architectures over time. One company maintains four similar architectures in parallel, each at a different stage in their respective life-cycle, while the other has a single architecture for all products since 2002. The organisational belonging of the architects in the former company has been turbulent in contrast to the latter and there is some speculation if this is correlated."

However, many of these approaches lack of insights into how to manage complexities related to the multitude of applications developed in silos such as the various systems in health organizations that were designed independently from each other. This paper contributes to the solutions addressing this issue by proposing a methodology and tools to create foundations based on key components to help develop the information architecture at the heart of the enterprise architecture that can guarantee the evolution of the organization. These core components are a set of reusable Field Actions representing the non-contextual persistent information, a common canonical Corporate Conceptual Data Model capturing all the vital data in the organization, and Views or sub-schema of this global data model that represent information for different stakeholders in the organization. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach and to gain more insights into its practical value, the architecturing approach is applied in the healthcare domain to create the information architecture and the enterprise architecture for the Quebec healthcare network."

Our approach is based on non-intrusively collected data captured by a version control system and provides the project manager with timely updates. Further, we provide evidence of the applicability of our approach by investigating process conformance in a five day training class on eXtreme Programming (XP) practices at the Leibniz Universität Hannover. Our results show that the approach enabled researchers to formulate minimal intrusive methods to check for conformance and that for the majority of the investigated XP practices violations could be detected."

This approach was recently ported to the early development phase, when requirements are gathered and clarified. Among the existing proposals, Fit (Framework for Integrated Testing) supports the precise specification of requirements by means of so called Fit tables, which express relevant usage scenarios in a tabular format, easily understood also by the customer. Fit tables can be turned into executable test cases through the creation of pieces of glue code, called fixtures. In this paper, we test the claimed benefits of Fit through a series of three controlled experiments in which Fit tables and related fixtures are used to clarify a set of change requirements, in a software evolution scenario. Results indicate improved correctness achieved with no significant impact on time, however benefits of Fit vary in a substantial way depending on the developers' experience. Preliminary results on the usage of Fit in combination with pair programming revealed another relevant source of variation. "
601.0,Excluded,ec3,Are test cases needed? Replicated comparison between exploratory and test-case-based software testing,"Manual software testing is a widely practiced verification and validation method that is unlikely to fade away despite the advances in test automation. In the domain of manual testing, many practitioners advocate exploratory testing (ET), i.e., creative, experience-based testing without predesigned test cases, and they claim that it is more efficient than testing with detailed test cases. This paper reports a replicated experiment comparing effectiveness, efficiency, and perceived differences between ET and test-case-based testing (TCT) using 51 students as subjects, who performed manual functional testing on the jEdit text editor. Our results confirm the findings of the original study: 1) there is no difference in the defect detection effectiveness between ET and TCT, 2) ET is more efficient by requiring less design effort, and 3) TCT produces more false-positive defect reports than ET. Based on the small differences in the experimental design, we also put forward a hypothesis that the effectiveness of the TCT approach would suffer more than ET from time pressure. We also found that both approaches had distinctive issues: in TCT, the problems were related to correct abstraction levels of test cases, and the problems in ET were related to test design and logging of the test execution and results. Finally, we recognize that TCT has other benefits over ET in managing and controlling testing in large organizations."

A case study on causes and effects of overscoping in large-scale software engineering,"Context Scope management is a core part of software release management and often a key factor in releasing successful software products to the market. In a market-driven case, when only a few requirements are known a priori, the risk of overscoping may increase. Objective This paper reports on findings from a case study aimed at understanding overscoping in large-scale, market-driven software development projects, and how agile requirements engineering practices may affect this situation. Method Based on a hypothesis of which factors that may be involved in an overscoping situation, semi-structured interviews were performed with nine practitioners at a large, market-driven software company. The results from the interviews were validated by six (other) practitioners at the case company via a questionnaire. Results The results provide a detailed picture of overscoping as a phenomenon including a number of causes, root causes and effects, and indicate that overscoping is mainly caused by operating in a fast-moving market-driven domain and how this ever-changing inflow of requirements is managed. Weak awareness of overall goals, in combination with low development involvement in early phases, may contribute to â€˜biting offâ€™ more than a project can â€˜chewâ€™. Furthermore, overscoping may lead to a number of potentially serious and expensive consequences, including quality issues, delays and failure to meet customer expectations. Finally, the study indicates that overscoping occurs also when applying agile requirements engineering practices, though the overload is more manageable and perceived to result in less wasted effort when applying a continuous scope prioritization, in combination with gradual requirements detailing and a close cooperation within cross-functional teams. Conclusion The results provide an increased understanding of scoping as a complex and continuous activity, including an analysis of the causes, effects, and a discussion on possible impact of agile requirements engineering practices to the issue of overscoping. The results presented in this paper can be used to identify potential factors to address in order to achieve a more realistic project scope."

Using Problem Frames to Diagnose System Failures,"This paper reports on our experience of investigating the role of software systems in the power blackout that affected parts of the United States and Canada on 14 August 2003. Based on a detailed study of the official report on the blackout, our investigation has aimed to bring out requirements engineering lessons that can inform development practices for dependable software systems. Since the causes of failures are typically rooted in the complex structures of software systems and their world contexts, we have deployed and evaluated a framework that looks beyond the scope of software and into its physical context, directing attention to places in the system structures where failures are likely to occur. We report that (i) Problem Frames were effective in diagnosing the causes of failures and documenting the causes in a schematic and accessible way, and (ii) errors in addressing the concerns of biddable domains, model building problems, and monitoring problems had contributed to the blackout."

Requirements-Driven Self-Tuning for the Survivability of Web Systems,"Running in a highly uncertain and greatly complex environment, Web systems cannot always provide full set of services with optimal quality, especially when work loads are high or subsystem failures are frequent. Hence, it is significant to continuously maintain a high satisfaction level of survivability, hereafter survivability assurance, while relaxing or sacrificing certain quality or functional requirements that are not crucial to the survival of the entire system. After giving a value-based interpretation to survivability assurance to facilitate a quantitative analysis, we propose a requirements-driven self-tuning method for the survivability assurance of Web systems. Maintaining an enriched and live goal model, our method adapts to runtime tradeoff decisions made by our PID (proportional-integral-derivative) controller and goal-oriented reasoner for both quality and functional requirements. The goal-based configuration plans produced by the reasoner is carried out on the live goal model, and then mapped into system architectural configurations. Experiments on an online shopping system are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."

In analyzing our data, we deployed activity theory in concert with genre theory to better understand how participants repeatedly articulated and coarticulated finite, goal-directed, individual actions in the service of a broader, ongoing, shared objective. We offer, therefore, a way of understanding the Scrum process framework as a powerful orienting genre that facilitates collective development practice by stabilizing and intermediating a host of related, dynamic genres and artifacts."

Traditionally, testing is carried out during the last phases of the software development life cycle. As a consequence, testing activities are often subject to high time pressure, which either results in delayed market introduction or low product quality. The validation of functional and real-time requirements of embedded systems is a difficult task. It usually needs the electronic control unit and the controlled hardware components. But very often the hardware components are not available for testing the control software at the beginning of the development. In this paper, we paper presents how test cases can be designed from use cases and how embedded control software can be validated without hardware components by simulating the test cases in early development phases using the AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming). For achieving an aspect oriented testable format, extended UML sequence diagrams are applied to formalize sequences of events, which have been specified in the use case scenarios. Provided that black box aspect oriented is used for developing embedded component applications, the monitoring of the dynamic behavior inside the components is not possible during simulation. But the simulated dynamic behavior is observable on the connections between the software components. In such a way monitored and recorded time stamp events are finally compared offline against the expected sequences of events specified in the test cases. The offline comparison validates the simulated behavior by demonstrating the fulfillment of user requirements and by detecting errors in case of contradictions during modeling.

But a systematic mechanism that can be easily adopted to assess and interpret \{PSP\} effect is scarce within the existing literature. Objective The purpose of this study is to explore the possibility of devising a feasible assessment model that ties up critical software engineering values with the pertinent \{PSP\} metrics. Method A systematic review of the literature was conducted to establish such an assessment model (we called a Planâ€“Trackâ€“Review model). Both mean and median approaches along with a set of simplified procedures were used to assess the commonly accepted \{PSP\} training effects. A set of statistical analyses further followed to increase understanding of the relationships among the \{PSP\} metrics and to help interpret the application results. Results Based on the results of this study, \{PSP\} training effect on the controllability, manageability, and reliability of a software engineer is quite positive and largely consistent with the literature. However, its effect on oneâ€™s predictability on project in general (and on project size in particular) is not implied as said in the literature. As for oneâ€™s overall project efficiency, our results show a moderate improvement. Our initial finding also suggests that a prior stage \{PSP\} effect could have an impact on later stage training outcomes. Conclusion It is concluded that this Planâ€“Trackâ€“Review model with the associated framework can be used to assess \{PSP\} effect regarding a disciplined software development. The generated summary report serves to provide useful feedback for both \{PSP\} instructors and students based on internal as well as external standards."

To adopt an agile process, it is imperative to analyze and evaluate its effectiveness in supporting high quality software development while complying with stringent time constraints. In this paper we describe an agile method for Web-based application development (XWebProcess) and an experiment conducted with a group of forty senior undergraduate students to assess the quality/speed effectiveness of the proposed method vis-à-vis the effectiveness of Extreme Programming (XP). The results have shown that the process proposed is equally agile when compared to XP, moreover, surveys conducted as part of the experiment pointed out that XWebProcess is more suitable to Web development in dimensions such as requirements gathering, user interface and navigation design, and software testing, therefore leading to better quality software."

More specifically, every organization or team implements a customized agile method, tailored to better accommodate its needs. However, the extent to which a customized method supports the organizational objectives, i.e. the 'goodness' of that method, should be demonstrable. Existing agile assessment approaches focus on comparative analyses, or are limited in scope and application. In this research, we present a systematic, comprehensive approach to assessing the 'goodness' of agile methods. We examine an agile method based on (1) its adequacy, (2) the capability of the organization to support the adopted principles and practices specified by the method, and (3) the method's effectiveness. We employ the Objectives, Principles and Strategies (OPS) Framework to guide our assessment process. The Framework (a) specifies objectives of the agile philosophy, (b) identifies principles that support the objectives, (c) designates strategies that implement the principles, (d) defines linkages that relate objectives to principles, and principles to strategies, and (e) prescribes indicators for assessing the extent to which an organization supports the implementation and effectiveness of those strategies. The propagation of indicator values along the linkages provides a multi-level assessment view of the agile method. In this paper, we discuss our assessment approach and substantiation results."

This innovation leads to changing requirements due to changes in product features, laws, or the locality where the product is sold or manufactured. To help developers rationalize these changes, we introduce a preliminary framework and method that can be used by requirements engineers and their legal teams to identify relevant legal requirements and trace changes in requirements coverage. The framework includes a method to translate IT regulations into a legal requirements coverage model used to make coverage assertions about existing or planned IT systems. We evaluated the framework in a case study using three IT laws: California's Confidentiality of Medical Records Act, the U.S. Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and amendments from the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, and the India 2011 Information Technology Rules. Further, we demonstrate the framework using three scenarios: new product features are proposed; product-related services are outsourced abroad; and regulations change to address changes in the market."

Our interest is centered on their use in teachingâ€“learning contexts: the so-called m-learning. In this work we try to empirically analyze the use of these portable devices for accessing learning materials. To this end, two empirical studies have been conducted with the aim of analyzing the effectiveness of several interaction devices for supporting study tasks. In an initial experiment we compared conventional access, by means of a desktop computer, with the access through mobile phones. A replica of this first experiment was conducted to compare these two devices with the use of tablet devices. In both experiments we use several sources of information: subjective perception of the students, their profiles, their performance on a study task, as well as the physical evidence provided by an eye tracker. The results obtained allowed us to conclude that the use of devices with visualization limitations (such as mobile phones) is not suitable to access and visualize learning materials, due to the fact that they impose an additional cognitive load. The results also indicate positive perception of the use of \{PCs\} and iPads for studying, although the latter is considered more motivating for learners."

The goal of \{CUP\} is to classify usability problems further to give user interface developers better feedback to improve their understanding of usability problems, help them manage usability maintenance, enable them to find effective fixes for UP, and prevent such problems from reoccurring in the future. First, reliability was evaluated with raters of different levels of expertise and experience in using CUP. Second, acceptability was assessed with a questionnaire. Third, validity was assessed by developers in two field studies. An analytical comparison was also made to three other classification schemes. \{CUP\} reliability results indicated that the expertise and experience of raters are critical factors for assessing reliability consistently, especially for the more complex attributes. Validity analysis results showed that tools used by developers must be tailored to their working framework, knowledge and maturity. The acceptability study showed that practitioners are concerned with the effort spent in applying any tool. To understand developersâ€™ work and the implications of this study two theories are presented for understanding and prioritising UP. For applying classification schemes, the implications of this study are that training and context are needed."

Continuous integration often is not included, despite it becoming increasingly common in industry to code, test, and integrate at the same time. This paper describes a study whereby software engineering undergraduates were given a short intensive experience of test-driven development with continuous integration using an environment that imitated a typical industrial circumstance. Assessment was made of students' agile experience rather than of project deliverables, using a novel set of process measures that examined students' participation and performance in agile testing.

Future work will investigate automation of the assessment of continuous integration and configuration management server data."
618.0,Excluded,ec3,Assessment methodology for software process improvement in small organizations,"Context Diagnosing processes in a small company requires process assessment practices which give qualitative and quantitative results; these should offer an overall view of the process capability. The purpose is to obtain relevant information about the running of processes, for use in their control and improvement. However, small organizations have some problems in running process assessment, due to their specific characteristics and limitations. Objective This paper presents a methodology for assessing software processes which assist the activity of software process diagnosis in small organizations. There is an attempt to address issues such as the fact that: (i) process assessment is expensive and typically requires major company resources and (ii) many light assessment methods do not provide information that is detailed enough for diagnosing and improving processes. Method To achieve all this, the \{METvalCOMPETISOFT\} assessment methodology was developed. This methodology: (i) incorporates the strategy of internal assessments known as rapid assessment, meaning that these assessments do not take up too much time or use an excessive quantity of resources, nor are they too rigorous and (ii) meets all the requirements described in the literature for an assessment proposal which is customized to the typical features of small companies. Results This paper also describes the experience of the application of this methodology in eight small software organizations that took part in the \{COMPETISOFT\} project. The results obtained show that this approach allows us to obtain reliable information about the strengths and weaknesses of software processes, along with information to companies on opportunities for improvement. Conclusion The assessment methodology proposed sets out the elements needed to assist with diagnosing the process in small organizations step-by-step while seeking to make its application economically feasible in terms of resources and time. From the initial application it may be seen that this assessment methodology can be useful, practical and suitable for diagnosing processes in this type of organizations."
619.0,Excluded,ec3,Assisted behavior driven development using natural language processing,"In Behavior Driven Development (BDD), acceptance tests provide the starting point for the software design flow and serve as a basis for the communication between designers and stakeholders. In this agile software development technique, acceptance tests are written in natural language in order to ensure a common understanding between all members of the project. As a consequence, mapping the sentences to actual source code is the first step of the design flow, which is usually done manually. However, the scenarios described by the acceptance tests provide enough information in order to automatize the extraction of both the structure of the implementation and the test cases. In this work, we propose an assisted flow for BDD where the user enters into a dialog with the computer which suggests code pieces extracted from the sentences. For this purpose, natural language processing techniques are exploited. This allows for a semi-automatic transformation from acceptance tests to source code stubs and thus provides a first step towards an automatization of BDD."
620.0,Excluded,ec7,Assumption-Based Risk Identification Method (ARM) in Dynamic Service Provisioning,"In this paper we consider service-oriented applications composed of component services provided by different, economically independent service providers. As in all composite applications, the component services are composed and configured to meet requirements for the composite application. However, in a field experiment of composite service-oriented applications we found that, although the services as actually delivered by the service providers meet their requirements, there is still a mismatch across service providers due to unstated assumptions, and that this mismatch causes an incorrect composite application to be delivered to end-users. Identifying and analyzing these initially unstated assumptions turns requirements engineering for service-oriented applications into risk analysis.  In this paper, we describe a field experiment with an experimental service-oriented homecare system, in which unexpected behavior of the system turned up unstated assumptions about the contributing service providers. We then present an assumptions-driven risk identification method that can help identifying these risks, and we show how we applied this method in the second iteration of the field experiment. The method adapts some techniques from problem frame diagrams to identify relevant assumptions on service providers. The method is informal, and takes the ”view from nowhere” in that it does not result in a specification of the component services, but for every component service delivers a set of assumptions that the service must satisfy in order to contribute to the overall system requirements. We end the paper with a discussion of generalizability of this method."

In many scenarios, like small craft sailing or cross-country trekking, a complete replacement of maps is neither useful nor desirable. Paper maps are fail-safe, relatively cheap, offer superior resolution and provide large scale overview. In uses like open-water sailing it is therefore mandatory to carry adequate maps/charts. \{GPS\} based mobile devices, on the other hand, offer useful features like automatic positioning and plotting, real-time information update and dynamic adaptation to user requirements. While paper maps are now commonly used in combination with mobile \{GPS\} devices, there is no meaningful integration between the two, and the combined use leads to a number of interaction problems and potential safety issues. In this paper we explore the design space of augmented paper maps in which maps are augmented with additional functionality through a mobile device to achieve a meaningful integration between device and map that combines their respective strengths."

The most recent and full-featured CDEs typically provide presence and workspace awareness in one place, but lack any support to social awareness for reducing the sociocultural distance. We argue that disseminating social awareness information within a CDE can both speed up the establishment of a cross-organizational shared context and help developers who have little or no chances to meet and, then, develop trust-based inter-personal connections. For this reason, we propose to extend a commercial CDE in order to provide members of global software teams with information collected from corporate microblogging and professional social network"

However, the effectiveness of these methods cannot always be satisfactorily proved. Prompted by this, this paper proposes a model for assessing students based on real market practices while preserving the authenticity of the learning environment. To evaluate this model, a case study on skills training for software specialists for the Telecom market is discussed, and presents important results that show the applicability of the proposed model for teaching Software Engineering."

Some approaches to quantifying and addressing this problem are introduced."
627.0,Excluded,ec3,Automated acceptance test refactoring,"With the increasing popularity of agile software development and Test-Driven-Development, also maintenance of acceptance test has become an important issue. In this paper, we describe a concept and a tool for automated acceptance test maintenance using a refactoring approach. Acceptance tests are user tests which are used to determine if a system satisfies acceptance criteria and to enable a customer to determine whether or not to accept the system. In agile development acceptance test are also used as a mean for specification, i.e. acceptance tests are written in advance to the production code (called Behavior-Driven-Development - BDD). In an agile project this poses three major challenges with respect to maintenance of acceptance tests: new requirements may cause changes in the acceptance criteria, which require the system under test to be adapted; when the system under test undergoes a major restructuring, even the acceptance test might have to be adapted; with the increasing acceptance test suite in an agile project the tests themselves may undergo a major reorganization. Having a large acceptance test base, doing these refactorings manually is error prone and causes a lot of effort. In this paper we present a concept and tool for executing automated refactoring for Fit acceptance tests, which significantly reduces the effort for test maintenance and makes them much less error prone."

We show how ATDD can be seen as a mix of the traditional RE focus on documentation and the agile focus on iterative communication. ATDD can mitigate some of the inherent risks in RE. It also carries with it the need for a proper domain and a very rigorous development method that requires disciplined developers and dedicated customers, preferably on-site."

A key part of an \{SPL\} is a model that captures the rules for reconfiguring the software. \{SPLs\} commonly use feature models to capture \{SPL\} configuration rules. Each \{SPL\} configuration is represented as a selection of features from the feature model. Invalid \{SPL\} configurations can be created due to feature conflicts introduced via staged or parallel configuration or changes to the constraints in a feature model. When invalid configurations are created, a method is needed to automate the diagnosis of the errors and repair the feature selections. This paper provides two contributions to research on automated configuration of SPLs. First, it shows how configurations and feature models can be transformed into constraint satisfaction problems to automatically diagnose errors and repair invalid feature selections. Second, it presents empirical results from diagnosing configuration errors in feature models ranging in size from 100 to 5,000 features. The results of our experiments show that our CSP-based diagnostic technique can scale up to models with thousands of features."
632.0,Included,included,Automated error analysis for the agilization of feature modeling,"Software Product Lines (SPL) and agile methods share the common goal of rapidly developing high-quality software. Although they follow different approaches to achieve it, some synergies can be found between them by (i) applying agile techniques to \{SPL\} activities so \{SPL\} development becomes more agile; and (ii) tailoring agile methodologies to support the development of SPL. Both options require an intensive use of feature models, which are usually strongly affected by changes on requirements. Changing large-scale feature models as a consequence of changes on requirements is a well-known error-prone activity. Since one of the objectives of agile methods is a rapid response to changes in requirements, it is essential an automated error analysis support in order to make \{SPL\} development more agile and to produce error-free feature models. As a contribution to find the intended synergies, this article sets the basis to provide an automated support to feature model error analysis by means of a framework which is organized in three levels: a feature model level, where the problem of error treatment is described; a diagnosis level, where an abstract solution that relies on Reiterâ€™s theory of diagnosis is proposed; and an implementation level, where the abstract solution is implemented by using Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP). To show an application of our proposal, a real case study is presented where the Feature-Driven Development (FDD) methodology is adapted to develop an SPL. Current proposals on error analysis are also studied and a comparison among them and our proposal is provided. Lastly, the support of new kinds of errors and different implementation levels for the proposed framework are proposed as the focus of our future work."

Automated refactoring to design patterns enables significant contributions to design quality even from developers with little experience on the use of the required patterns. Objective This work targets the automated identification of refactoring opportunities to the Strategy design pattern and the elimination through polymorphism of respective â€œcode smellsâ€� that are related to extensive use of complex conditional statements. Method An algorithm is introduced for the automated identification of refactoring opportunities to the Strategy design pattern. Suggested refactorings comprise conditional statements that are characterized by analogies to the Strategy design pattern, in terms of the purpose and selection mode of strategies. Moreover, this work specifies the procedure for refactoring to Strategy the identified conditional statements. For special cases of these statements, a technique is proposed for total replacement of conditional logic with method calls of appropriate concrete Strategy instances. The identification algorithm and the refactoring procedure are implemented and integrated in the \{JDeodorant\} Eclipse plug-in. The method is evaluated on a set of Java projects, in terms of quality of the suggested refactorings and run-time efficiency. The relevance of the identified refactoring opportunities is verified by expert software engineers. Results The identification algorithm recalled, from the projects used during evaluation, many of the refactoring candidates that were identified by the expert software engineers. Its execution time on projects of varying size confirmed the run-time efficiency of this method. Conclusion The proposed method for automated refactoring to Strategy contributes to simplification of conditional statements. Moreover, it enhances system extensibility through the Strategy design pattern."

When using RTMs to support the V&V of mission-or safety-critical systems, however, a human analyst must vet the candidate RTMs. The focus thus becomes the quality of the final RTM. This paper investigate show human analysts perform when vetting candidate RTMs. Specifically, a study was undertaken at two universities and had 26 participants analyze RTMs of varying accuracy for a Java code formatter program. The study found that humans tend to move their candidate RTM toward the line that represents recall = precision.

Requirements engineers analyze these documents as sources of requirements, but this analysis is a time-consuming and mostly manual process. Moreover, policy documents contain legalese and present readability challenges to requirements engineers seeking to analyze them. In this paper, we perform a large-scale analysis of 2,061 policy documents, including policy documents from the Google Top 1000 most visited websites and the Fortune 500 companies, for three purposes: (1) to assess the readability of these policy documents for requirements engineers; (2) to determine if automated text mining can indicate whether a policy document contains requirements expressed as either privacy protections or vulnerabilities; and (3) to establish the generalizability of prior work in the identification of privacy protections and vulnerabilities from privacy policies to other policy documents.

However, without specifications, developers cannot inspect the execution of each automatically generated test input practically. To address the problem, we have developed an automatic test abstraction tool, called Abstra, to extract high level object-state-transition information from unit-test executions, without requiring a priori specifications. Given a class and a set of its generated test inputs, our tool extracts object state machines (OSM): a state in an OSM represents an object state of the class and a transition in an OSM represents method calls of the class. When an object state in an OSM is concrete (being represented by the values of all fields reachable from the object), the size of the OSM could be too large to be useful for inspection. To address this issue, we have developed techniques in the tool to abstract object states based on returns of observer methods, branch coverage of methods, and individual object fields, respectively. The tool provides useful object-state-transition information for programmers to inspect unit-test executions effectively. In particular, the tool helps facilitate correctness inspection, program understanding, fault isolation, and test characterization."

The glossary terms are identified in two steps - a) compute units (which are candidates for glossary terms) b) disambiguate between the mutually exclusive units to identify terms. We introduce novel linguistic techniques to identify process nouns, abstract nouns and auxiliary verbs. The identification of units also handles co-ordinating conjunctions and adjectival modifiers. This requires solving co-ordination ambiguity and adjectival modifier ambiguity. The identification of terms among the units adapts an in-document statistical metric. We present an evaluation of our method over a real-life set of software requirements' documents and compare our results with that of a base algorithm. The intricate linguistic classification and the tackling of ambiguity result in superior performance of our approach over the base algorithm."

The changes of composite service mainly cover three types, i.e., the processes, bindings, and interfaces. In this article, an approach is proposed to select test cases for regression testing of different versions of \{BPEL\} (business process execution language) composite service where these changes are involved. The approach identifies the changes by performing control flow analysis and comparing the paths in a new version of composite service with those in the old one using a kind of eXtensible \{BPEL\} flow graph (XBFG). Message sequence is appended to \{XBFG\} path so that \{XBFG\} can fully describe the behavior of composite service. The binding and predicate constraint information added in different \{XBFG\} elements can be used for path selection and even for test case generation. Both theoretic analysis and case study show that the proposed approach is effective."
642.0,Excluded,ec3,Automatically generating tests from natural language descriptions of software behavior,"Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is an emerging agile development approach where all stakeholders (including developers and customers) work together to write user stories in structured natural language to capture a software application's functionality in terms of required ""behaviors."" Developers can then manually write ""glue"" code so that these scenarios can be translated into executable software tests. This glue code represents individual steps within unit and acceptance test cases, and tools exist that automate the mapping from scenario descriptions to manually written code steps (typically using regular expressions). This paper takes the position that, instead of requiring programmers to write manual glue code, it is practical to convert natural language scenario descriptions into executable software tests fully automatically. To show feasibility, this paper presents preliminary results from a tool called Kirby that uses natural language processing techniques to automatically generate executable software tests from structured English scenario descriptions. Kirby relieves the developer from the laborious work of writing code for the individual steps described in scenarios, so that both developers and customers can both focus on the scenarios as pure behavior descriptions (understandable to all, not just programmers). Preliminary results from assessing the performance and accuracy of this technique are presented. Copyright Â© 2013 SCITEPRESS."

Furthermore, our studies shows that the serious problems encountered by traditional information systems are now further exacerbated in web information systems and cooperative scientific databases where the frequency of schema changes has increased while tolerance for downtimes has nearly disappeared. ThePRISM project seeks to develop the methods and tools that turn this error-prone and time-consuming process into one that is controllable, predictable and avoids down-time. Toward this goal, we have assembled a large testbed of schema evolution histories, and developed a language of Schema Modification Operators (SMO) to express concisely these histories. Using this language, the database administrator can specify new schema changes, and then rely on PRISM to (i) predict the effect of these changes on current applications, (ii) translate old queries and updates to work on the new schema version, (iii) perform data migration, and (iv) generate full documentation of intervened changes. Furthermore, PRISM achieves good usability and scalability by incorporating recent advances on mapping composition and invertibility in the implementation of (ii). The progress in automating schema evolution so achieved provides the enabling technology for other advances, such as light-weight database design methodologies that embrace changes as the regular state of software. While these topics remain largely unexplored, and thus provide rich opportunities for future research, an important area which we have been investigated is that of archival information systems, where PRISM query mapping techniques were used to support flashback and historical queries for database archives under schema evolution."

We propose to use change-oriented programming as a means to detect bugs in a system while it is being developed. Not only may this technique assists in detecting bugs sooner, it can also be used to provide the developer with fine-grained information about the places in the program and test code that relate to the defect.

However, recent investigations have suggested that participation in contact sports may have a negative effect on cognitive function without the existence of a medically diagnosed concussion. The purpose of this study was to examine balance control during gait in concussed and uninjured athletes and non-athletes. Twenty-eight Grade 2 concussed individuals (14 athletes and 14 non-athletes) and 28 uninjured matched controls (14 athletes and 14 non-athletes) were assessed for their gait performance within 48&#xa0;h, 5, 14, and 28 days post-injury under conditions of divided and undivided attention. Athletes, whether concussed or not, walked slower and swayed more and faster than non-athletes. Athletes consistently demonstrated gait imbalance even in the absence of concussion. The findings of this study support the supposition that participation in high-impact sports has a measurable and possibly detrimental effect on balance control in the absence of a medically diagnosed concussion."
650.0,Excluded,ec7,Balancing act: community and local requirements in an open source development process,"Established best practices in software development tend to assume that a product's intended stakeholders (i.e., users, customers, and clients) are fairly well known and generally accessible. This paper outlines specific issues faced by those who conduct requirements analysis in the context of open source projects in which the user communities are widely distributed. The examples described are drawn from the experience of managing tool development within the Sakai Project [1], a higher education effort to build and share a community source framework for supporting on-line collaboration in academic courses and projects. With a far-flung community of users and developers, this project requires new approaches to eliciting, analyzing, and prioritizing user needs. The issues outlined in this paper are currently being met by a preliminary set of solutions that makes use of web-based project management technologies. These technologies along with some planning and communication strategies help improve the decision-making process involved in deciding whether and how to choose among proposed constraints, use cases, and feature requests."

Based on a Grounded Theory study of 40 Agile practitioners across 16 software development organizations in New Zealand and India, we describe how self-organizing Agile teams perform balancing acts between (a) freedom and responsibility (b) cross-functionality and specialization, and (c) continuous learning and iteration pressure, in an effort to maintain their self-organizing nature. We discuss the relationship between these three balancing acts and the fundamental conditions of self-organizing teams - autonomy, cross-fertilization, and self-transcendence."
652.0,Included,included,Balancing agile and structured development approaches to successfully manage large distributed software projects: A case study from the cruise line industry,"Agile methods and traditional structured approaches are often viewed as competing bi-polar choices. Agile methods such as Scrum and XP are recommended for small, co-located projects that involve changing requirements. The traditional structured plan-driven approaches, such as the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and the waterfall lifecycle frameworks, are recommended for large projects with stable requirements. If a project is large, strategically important, distributed, and has dynamic user requirements and organizational changes, it presents unique challenges that neither the agile methods nor the traditional structured approaches can effectively deal with alone. Although there is an increasing call for a balanced approach, there is little empirical research that shows when and how the two approaches can complement each other. Based on a case study from the cruise line industry of a large distributed strategic project with unanticipated changes, we conclude that this balance is not only workable, but is essential to ensure that the project demonstrates both control and agility for achieving its challenging and dynamic goals. Agile without structure can cause chaos, particularly in large complex distributed projects where planning, control, and coordination are critical. Structure without agility can lead to rigidity, particularly when a project involves a great deal of learning, discovery, and changes. Â© 2010 by the authors."

658.0,Excluded,ec3,Barriers towards integrated product development â€” Challenges from a holistic project management perspective,"Abstract The basis for product development in many large industrial companies is a traditional project management method positing non-overlapping phases, independent activities, and a dedicated project team. Research findings indicate that the use of integrated product development methods increases performance compared to traditional methods in contexts of complex problem solving, which are disruptive and non-linear. Even though integrated product development has been the focus of a large number of research studies, these studies mostly focus on identifying success criteria and improving performance, while the requirements for implementing integrated product development remain under-researched. This study takes a more holistic project management perspective and identifies both the challenges and the requirements of successful implementation through an in-depth case study. It was found in a chosen case company that successful implementation requires awareness and skills of integrated product development in senior management, as well as a set of cross-organizational project governance structures."

Undergraduate students in two 2nd and 3rd year IT subjects designed, specified and coded a Battleship LBG. This required them to consider physical and cognitive play experiences in figural and physical design spaces and address emergent properties of ubiquitous contexts. Our methods reconciled physical methods and enacted knowledge with traditional systematized design and development processes. We iteratively, integrated tangible and conceptual activities (e.g. bodystorming, prototyping of different fidelities, game concept abstraction, agile UP). We suggest these, differentially, supported students use of indexical resources and the assimilation of their embodied knowledge into design."

This methodology is supported by the open source framework (BEAST Tool) which automatically generates test cases skeletons from BDD scenarios specifications. The developed framework allows the testing of MASs based on JADE or JADEX platforms. In addition, this framework offers a set of configurable Mock Agents with the aim of being able to execute tests while the MAS is under development. The BEAST Methodology presents transparent traceability from user requirements to test cases. Thus, the stakeholders can be aware of the project status. The methodology and the associated tool have been validated in the development of a MAS for fault diagnosis in FTTH (Fiber To The Home) networks. The results have been measured in quantifiable way obtaining a reduction of the tests implementation time."
661.0,Excluded,ec3,Behavioral aspects of enterprise systems adoption: An empirical study on cultural factors,"Recently, behavioral aspects of enterprise systems have been called to investigate further in the information systems (IS) community. The purpose of this paper is to apply individual-level measurement of cultural orientation, such as power distance and uncertainty avoidance, to the recent findings of computer self-efficacy and \{ERP\} adoption belief, such as perceived ease of use, based on the survey of 101 \{ERP\} system experts. An online survey methodology is used to gather data from the various industrial fields. The research model is constructed based on the findings of the previous studies in IS, management, and cultural psychology. The results indicate that low power distance and high uncertainty avoidance cultural orientation influence general CSE. In addition, uncertainty avoidance positively influences ease of use of \{ERP\} systems. As expected, general \{CSE\} positively influences ease of use of \{ERP\} systems. Training and managerial interventions through communication to improve these cultural orientations would be effective for the successful \{ERP\} systems project. The findings of this research would be helpful to the project managers, \{IS\} researchers, and \{ERP\} practitioners who want to understand the behavioral aspects of \{ERP\} systems adoption in the organization."

In this paper we define a \{UML\} profile that allows users to create executable Foundational \{UML\} (fUML) stories and scenarios. In order to easily construct scenarios we introduce a \{BDD\} model library which contains fUML activities for testing equalities and inclusions.

671.0,Included,included,Beyond the customer: Opening the agile systems development process,"Context A particular strength of agile systems development approaches is that they encourage a move away from â€˜introvertedâ€™ development, involving the customer in all areas of development, leading to more innovative and hence more valuable information system. However, a move toward open innovation requires a focus that goes beyond a single customer representative, involving a broader range of stakeholders, both inside and outside the organisation in a continuous, systematic way. Objective This paper provides an in-depth discussion of the applicability and implications of open innovation in an agile environment. Method We draw on two illustrative cases from industry. Results We highlight some distinct problems that arose when two project teams tried to combine agile and open innovation principles. For example, openness is often compromised by a perceived competitive element and lack of transparency between business units. In addition, minimal documentation often reduce effective knowledge transfer while the use of short iterations, stand-up meetings and presence of on-site customer reduce the amount of time for sharing ideas outside the team. Conclusion A clear understanding of the inter- and intra-organisational applicability and implications of open innovation in agile systems development is required to address key challenges for research and practice."

That study applied the Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax (EARS) templates to the requirements for the certification of an aero engine control system contained in an airworthiness regulatory document. This paper reports on a wider series of experiments, which applied the templates to several different sets of requirement documents. Back-to-back comparisons were undertaken for documents before and after the application of the EARS templates. During these studies the templates were refined, known limitations of EARS were addressed and metrics were collected. The results strongly support the hypothesis that a small set of simple requirement structures would be an efficient way to enhance the writing of high-level stakeholder requirements. The implications of the results are discussed and additional guidance is provided through Lessons Learned, with the aim of making the templates easier to apply."
680.0,Excluded,ec3,Big Visible Testing,"Software testing is a key part of software development, so it's important that the testers be as effective as possible. Especially in fast-feedback agile teams, software testers must respond to their teammates' need for information with readily available, easy-to-understand testing materials. The novel twist of turning user experience personas inward to focus on the product team members provides deep insights into both what decisions team members need to make and how to present testing information to them to support those decisions. Having established personas as the context for the testing work, testers are poised to spring into action, planning, estimating, and executing both exploratory testing and user-facing automation. Testers then surface the results of this work to the product team in a way that helps them to address concerns in a timely fashion. Big visible charts display testing for co-located teams in a particularly effective form. Testers experiment with a variety of big visible representations throughout the life of the team, retaining these charts only as long as they provide value for decision-making and moving on to other forms as the team learns more about satisfying their information-gathering needs through testing. User personas produce a fresh perspective on product team members to help testers to focus on the value big visible testing artifacts provide to the individuals on a software development team."
681.0,Excluded,ec7,Binding requirements and component architecture by using model-based test-driven development,"Model-based testing is a well known technique to generate automatically highly qualitative tests for a given system based on a simplified testing model. Test-driven development is an established development practice in the agile development projects, which implies firstly the partial specification of a system by using tests, and after this, the development of the system. In test driven development the system implementation is continuously checked against the tests in order to assess its correctness with respect to the specification. In this paper we investigate how can these two methods be combined such that the advantages of these two approaches can be leveraged: highly qualitative test-cases used as specification of requirements and support of a continuous checking of architecture. We propose to formalize sub-sets of requirements into models that are amenable to generate tests by using automatic techniques well-known from model based testing. These tests can then be used to check the system architecture specification against the requirements in a continuous manner."

Unfortunately, the lack of a rigorous software structuring can undermine the maintainability, communicability and replicability of the process. To ameliorate this problem we propose the Leaf system, the aim of which is to seamlessly introduce the pipeline formality on top of a dynamical development process with minimum overhead for the programmer, thus providing a simple layer of software structuring. Results Leaf includes a formal language for the definition of pipelines with code that can be transparently inserted into the user’s Python code. Its syntax is designed to visually highlight dependencies in the pipeline structure it defines. While encouraging the developer to think in terms of bioinformatic pipelines, Leaf supports a number of automated features including data and session persistence, consistency checks between steps of the analysis, processing optimization and publication of the analytic protocol in the form of a hypertext. Conclusions Leaf offers a powerful balance between plan-driven and change-driven development environments in the design, management and communication of bioinformatic pipelines.

Even when the development of new components mostly reuses existing components or libraries and only small amounts of new code must be created, dealing with the component glue code and software build processes to obtain complete applications is still tedious and error-prone. Component-based software meant to reduce complexity at the application level increases complexity with the attendant glue code. To address these needs, we introduce Bocca, the first tool to enable application developers to perform rapid component prototyping while maintaining robust software-engineering practices suitable to HPC environments. Bocca provides project management and a comprehensive build environment for creating and managing applications composed of CommonComponent Architecture components. Of critical importance for HPC applications, Bocca is designed to operate in a language-agnostic way, simultaneously handling components written in any of the languages commonly used in scientific applications: C, C++, Fortran, Fortran77, Python,and Java. Bocca automates the tasks related to the component glue code, freeing the user to focus on the scientific aspects of the application.

The goal of these programs is to bring physicians, nurses, and social workers to the homes of the lower income population in lesser-attended regions within multi-million people metropolis. However, there is practically no IT support for the operation of these programs, leading to inefficiencies. For example, in a particular Primary Homecare Program our group is involved with, nurses visit the homes of their patients carrying a pencil and a piece of paper and, during their visits, found themselves isolated from the Primary Healthcare Center, the University Hospital, and the physicians who could provide them with important information to improve the quality of the services they provide. Each visit associated with the program results in a three-page report, which is handwritten and stored in cabinets, with no possibility for information summarization, statistical analysis, or data mining. In this paper, we describe the architectural design, the prototype implementation, and our preliminary experiences with the Borboleta system, whose goal is to use Mobile Computing technologies to promote digital inclusion as well as to improve the quality of Preventive Healthcare services offered by the public sector. We focus primarily in developing software that runs on PDAs used by health professionals while providing home healthcare.

However, in practice, traceability links are often created towards the end of the project specifically for approval or certification purposes. This practice can result in inaccurate and incomplete traces, and also means that traceability links are not available to support early development efforts. We address these problems by presenting a trace recommender system which pushes recommendations to project stakeholders as they create or modify traceable artifacts. We also introduce the novel concept of a trace obligation, which is used to track satisfaction relations between a target artifact and a set of source artifacts. We model traceability events and subsequent actions, including user recommendations, using the Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN). We demonstrate and evaluate the efficacy of our approach through an illustrative example and a simulation conducted using the software engineering artifacts of a robotic system for supporting arm rehabilitation. Our results show that tracking trace obligations and generating trace recommendations throughout the active phases of a project can lead to early construction of traceability knowledge."

In practice, it is difficult to manage and control user-centered design and system development processes separately. Based on a case study conducted in two software product companies, we have aimed to understand the role of usability specialists in the requirements engineering (RE) process. Our findings indicate that usability is still often seen as user interface design instead of a more comprehensive characteristic of a software product. Therefore, usability specialists had difficulties participating in early RE activities. To integrate usability as a natural part of the RE process, the usability teams have started to organize training in their companies. The main purpose of the training is to ensure that usability is not relying solely on the work of specialists but becomes a common responsibility for the whole product development organization."

For that, a case study was conducted at Ericsson R&D Finland, which successfully adopted Scrum in 2009 and subsequently started a comprehensible transition to Lean in 2010. Focus groups were conducted with company representatives to help devise a questionnaire supporting the creation of a Lean mindset in the company (Team Amplifier). Afterwards, the questionnaire was used in 16 teams based in Finland, Hungary and China to evaluate the status of the transformation. By using Lean thinking, Ericsson R&D Finland has made important improvements to the quality of its products, customer satisfaction and transparency within the organization. Moreover, build times have been reduced over ten times and the number of commits per day has increased roughly five times.The study makes two main contributions to research. First, the main factors that have enabled Ericsson R&D’s achievements are analysed. Elements such as ‘network of product owners’, ‘continuous integration’, ‘work in progress limits’ and ‘communities of practice’ have been identified as being of fundamental importance. Second, three categories of challenges in using Lean Software Development were identified: ‘achieving flow’, ‘transparency’ and ‘creating a learning culture’."
702.0,Excluded,ec7,Business Requirements Analysis and Development for Legacy System Replacement Projects in Government Organizations,"E-Government innovation is commonly hindered by legacy systems in public sector agencies. Legacy systems not only present technical constraints, but they also embed outdated and inefficient business processes. A critical manifestation of this issue occurs during the requirements phase of e-government projects, where requirements tend to mimic the features of old systems that must be modernized or replaced. The problem is not easy to identify and qualify, unless a critical stance to requirements analysis is taken, and unless requirements are examined in the context of processes that are creative, exploratory and collaborative. We propose a solution to legacy reproduction issues in the development of a game-based tool that through competition enables the analysis and transformation of business requirements by applying risk and opportunity criteria."

705.0,Excluded,ec3,Calculating Software Process Improvement's Return on Investment,"Many organizations and firms invest in software process improvement (SPI). They do this in order to satisfy business goals for customer satisfaction, time-to-market, cost, quality, and reliability. Return on investment (ROI) is a traditional approach for measuring the business or monetary value of an investment. As such, it can be used for measuring the economic benefit of investing in SPI. Measuring the \{ROI\} of \{SPI\} is still in its early infancy, in spite of the fact that \{ROI\} has been around for many decades and the discipline of \{SPI\} itself has also been popular for at least 20 years. It is important to note that \{ROI\} is a metric that can be used before and after an investment in SPI. \{ROI\} can be used to evaluate (a priori) investment opportunities and make a proper selection and \{ROI\} can be used to evaluate (a posteriori) the extent to which an investment was legitimate. Although the value of using \{ROI\} for \{SPI\} calculations seems self evident, using \{ROI\} in practice often proves difficult. In this chapter we provide an overview of how to apply \{ROI\} calculations to enhance decision making processes involving SPI. We approach these calculations from two dimensions: modelling and measuring. For each of these dimensions we provide pragmatic approaches for real-life decision making, all illustrated with actual case studies. The chapter contains guidelines, approaches, and experiences on how to do this in practice. It supports making simple but sound financial evaluations when using \{SPI\} to improve organizational performance. The main message of this chapter is that \{ROI\} can and must be calculated for most \{SPI\} investment decisions as a means of ultimately satisfying business goals and objectives. \{ROI\} can and should be an explicit part of software management and engineering decision making processes when it comes to SPI, which can minimize effort, costs, and financial investments. Software managers and engineers should include financial considerations such as \{ROI\} in their decisions, as well as technical ones, in order to satisfy business goals and objectives for SPI."
707.0,Excluded,ec3,Can agile methods enhance mechatronics design education?,"This paper presents a study of the integration of agile methods into mechatronics design education, as performed at \{KTH\} Royal Institute of Technology. The chosen method, Scrum, and the context of the studied capstone course are presented. With the integration of Scrum into the capstone projects, an educational favorable alternative is identified, to previously used design methodologies such as more traditional stage-gate methods as the Waterfall or method or the V-model. This is due to the emphasis on early prototyping, quick feedback and incremental development. It still might not be the favorable method for use in large scale industrial development projects where formal procedures might still be preferred, but the pedagogical advantages in mechatronics education are valuable. Incremental development and rapid prototyping for example gives many opportunities for students to reflect and improve. The Scrum focus on self-organizing teams also provides a platform to practice project organization, by empowering students to take responsibility for the product development process. Among the results of this study, it is shown that it is possible and favorable to integrate Scrum in a mechatronics capstone course and that this can enhance student preparation for a future career as mechatronics designers or product developers. It is also shown that this prepares the students with a larger flexibility to handle the increased complexity in mechatronics product development and thereby enabling the project teams to deliver results faster, more reliable and with higher quality."

One characterization of software complexity is the existence of dependency relationship. Moreover, degree of dependency reflects the cohesion and coupling between software elements. Dependencies on design and implementation phase have been proven as important predictors for software bugs. We empirically investigated how requirements dependencies correlate with and predict software integration bugs, which can provide early estimate regarding software quality, therefore facilitate decision making early in the software lifecycle. We conducted network analysis on requirements dependency networks of two commercial software projects. We then performed correlation analysis between network measures (e.g., degree, closeness) and number of bugs. Afterwards, bug prediction models were built using these network measures. Significant correlation is observed between most of our network measures and number of bugs. These network measures can predict the number of bugs with high accuracy and sensitivity. We further identified the significant predictors for bug prediction. Besides, the indication effect of network measures on bug number varies among different types of requirements dependency. These observations show that requirements dependency network can be used as an early indicator of software Integration bugs."

Nevertheless, how to build trust among developers with few or no chances to meet is an open issue. To overcome such a challenge, we hypothesize that increased social awareness may foster trust building in global software teams. In this paper, we present two different empirical studies, specifically designed to test our hypotheses."

However, our intentions were impeded by the problem of finding appropriate subject systems that included sufficient information in both requirements and architecture document. Most subject systems that we found contained either detailed requirements or detailed architecture description, but not both. In this paper, we report on our search and the seventeen most suitable subject systems with the hope of aiding others undertaking a similar study.

The analysis is essential for project planning, system verification and validation, and integration coordination. For software requirements, researchers and practitioners have identified a set of categories, such as functional, performance, safety, to categorize a requirement. In a large systems engineering and integration project comprised of not only software but also hardware and activities in other disciplines (e.g., electrical, civil engineering), we encountered many additional, different aspects of the system that need to be analyzed and thus the requirements need to be categorized for those aspects. This experience report describes the lessons learnt in categorizing requirements in this project. The report provides insights for the practical issues of the categorization and our research on how more effectively the categorization could be done."

The codec is used in VoIP applications for sending speech over internet protocol. We started from the standard reference C implementation and generated several customized designs using the NISCT C-to-RTL toolset.

The use of the electromagnetic spectrum depends on these parameters. With future applications such as opportunistic overlay access or distributed spectrum monitoring in mind, it is important to estimate the state of the communication space on the basis of incomplete or imprecise information. A promising approach are technology centric Cognitive Radio networks. In these networks, nodes cooperate to infer information on spectral occupancy.

In this work, we present Cerno, a framework for semi-automatic semantic annotation of textual documents according to a domain-specific semantic model. The proposed framework is founded on light-weight techniques and tools intended for legacy code analysis and markup. To illustrate the feasibility of our proposal, we report experimental results of its application to two different domains. These results suggest that light-weight semi-automatic techniques for semantic annotation are feasible, require limited human effort for adaptation to a new domain, and demonstrate markup quality comparable with state-of-the-art methods."

Optimized variability management can lead a software company to 1) shorter development lead time, 2) improved customer and improved user satisfaction, 3) reduced complexity of product management (more variability, same )and4)reducedcosts(samevariability,less). However, it is not easy for software companies, especially small and medium size of enterprises to deal with variability. In this paper we present variability challenges and used practices collected from five SMEs. Our study indicates that increased product complexity can lead growing SMEs to the time-consuming decision-making. Many of the analyzed medium size of companies also expect improved tool support to help them to boost their productivity when managing increasingly complex products and increasing amount of variants In fact, in many of the analysed SMEs, a high level of automation in design, release management and testing are or become a key factor for market success By introducing the challenges and used practices related to variability the paper deepens understanding of this highly relevant but relatively under-researched phenomenon and contributes to the literature on software product line engineering."
726.0,Excluded,ec7,Challenges and practices in aligning requirements with verification and validation: a case study of six companies,"Weak alignment of requirements engineering (RE) with verification and validation (VV) may lead to problems in delivering the required products in time with the right quality. For example, weak communication of requirements changes to testers may result in lack of verification of new requirements and incorrect verification of old invalid requirements, leading to software quality problems, wasted effort and delays. However, despite the serious implications of weak alignment research and practice both tend to focus on one or the other of RE or VV rather than on the alignment of the two. We have performed a multi-unit case study to gain insight into issues around aligning RE and VV by interviewing 30 practitioners from 6 software developing companies, involving 10 researchers in a flexible research process for case studies. The results describe current industry challenges and practices in aligning RE with VV, ranging from quality of the individual RE and VV activities, through tracing and tools, to change control and sharing a common understanding at strategy, goal and design level. The study identified that human aspects are central, i.e. cooperation and communication, and that requirements engineering practices are a critical basis for alignment. Further, the size of an organisation and its motivation for applying alignment practices, e.g. external enforcement of traceability, are variation factors that play a key role in achieving alignment. Our results provide a strategic roadmap for practitioners improvement work to address alignment challenges. Furthermore, the study provides a foundation for continued research to improve the alignment of RE with VV."

However, despite the great deal of research in the area, a number of challenges still need to be faced (i) to make agent-based computing a widely accepted paradigm in software engineering practice, and (ii) to turn agent-oriented software abstractions into practical tools for facing the complexity of modern application areas. In this paper, after a short introduction to the key concepts of agent-based computing (as they pertain to software engineering), we characterise the emerging key issues in multiagent systems (MASs) engineering. In particular, we show that such issues can be analysed in terms of three different “scales of observation”, i.e., in analogy with the scales of observation of physical phenomena, in terms of micro, macro, and meso scales. Based on this characterisation, we discuss, for each scale of observation, what are the peculiar engineering issues arising, the key research challenges to be solved, and the most promising research directions to be explored in the future."

In general, the task of developing new aircraft is risky and an extremely complex task, and aircraft manufacturers seek to control this complexity by adopting an evolutionary approach. Introducing new ways of controlling this complexity has the potential benefit of reducing the risk associated with aircraft development and enabling the development of revolutionary aircraft. One such new way is based on the application of agile principles. This paper discusses the application of agile principles on aircraft development processes to eliminate to a certain degree the involved complexity of conventional aircraft development processes."
729.0,Excluded,ec7,Challenges in Balancing the Amount of Solution Information in Requirement Specifications for Embedded Products,"Requirements are traditionally viewed as being free of the details of an envisioned solution and specified using purely problem domain entities. Preventing premature design in the requirements permits the available design space not to be restricted too early which might inhibit innovative designs. In practice, on many industrial projects, separating the problem and solution domain entities can be difficult, and arguably there are benefits for not doing so. Many customers feel more confident describing their requirements, often as the difference between the existing products and their needs, some customers have such intimate knowledge of their products that their requirements tend to be very specific, and if the customer knows the exact solution needed that naturally will reduce the cost of the requirements elicitation as well as design activities. Practitioners are challenged to understand when having solution information in requirements is sensible and when it should be avoided. In this research challenge paper, we advocate that researchers should identify different contexts and corresponding criteria that practitioners can use to evaluate when requirements specifications may include design information. To understand the research challenge we present experiences from real projects and suggest possible factors that affect when design information may be viable in requirements specifications."
730.0,Excluded,ec3,Challenges of applying ethnography to study software practices,"Ethnography is about the adoption of a cultural lens to observe and interpret events, actions, and behaviors, ensuring that they are placed in a relevant and meaningful context. Using this approach, it is possible to capture and analyze software development practices. Our aims are to illustrate the use of an ethnographic approach in a case study of agile software development adoption, to discuss the methodological challenges involved, and to provide support to others who conduct ethnographic studies of software practice. An ethnographic case study was conducted, employing participant observation, interviews, and document analysis. Difficulties and decisions were recorded and compared with those encountered in the literature. Finally, key challenges and guidelines to tackle them were discussed and documented. We identified five key challenges of applying ethnography to the study of software practices: (a) working in collaboration with and having something to offer to the participating company; (b) the insider/outsider dynamic of participant observation; (c) the balance between participant listening and participant observation; (d) the researcher's relationship with the participants; and (e) the rigor in qualitative work that involves the dilemma of the contextualization to be sufficiently broad and detailed. This study shows that ethnographic methods are indispensible when trying to understand software practice, and that the fundamental challenge for the researcher is to balance the role of participant observer with rigorous fieldwork."

732.0,Excluded,ec3,Challenges of real-time secondary usage of spectrum,"In this survey paper, we investigate some of the challenges to be addressed before a practical real-time secondary market for spectrum can be developed. We differentiate the methods of dynamic spectrum allocation as coordinated usage of resources, interworking solutions, integration solutions and secondary access of spectrum. Secondary spectrum access approaches are generally classified as real-time and non-real-time secondary access. However, the focus of this work is on real-time secondary spectrum utilization which can follow a negotiated or opportunistic access strategy. While different solutions for increasing spectrum utilization and efficiency are under investigation, many aspects of spectrum sharing technologies are still open questions. After an extensive literature survey, the major challenges and open questions of real-time secondary usage of spectrum are addressed here. We also provide some insights on potentially important design considerations and requirements when developing successful spectrum management schemes to realize real-time secondary spectrum usage."

One relatively peculiar application domain is the nuclear energy domain, which is characterized by the long life cycle of power plant operation and construction project, strict control of safety, and collaboration between several stakeholder groups including various branches of technology. We describe the state of the practice of requirements engineering in the nuclear energy domain in Finland on the basis of a descriptive case study focusing on the safety-related automation systems of the nuclear power plants. The results of the study indicate that explicit requirements engineering practices are becoming increasingly important due to the increasing complexity of the technology used, retirement of the older generation of experts, and construction of new power plants along with renewal of the existing nuclear power plants. The challenges of requirements engineering are especially within efficient communication and management of requirements. We highlight challenges that are emphasized by the characteristics of the nuclear energy domain but also discuss the more generic nature of these challenges. The identified challenges are in authority requirements, aging, communication, knowledge transfer, representation of requirements, and tool support."

Objective Our objective was to understand the challenges of shared decision-making in agile software development teams. Method We designed a multiple case study consisting of four projects in two software product companies that recently adopted Scrum. We collected data in semi-structured interviews, through participant observations, and from process artifacts. Results We identified three main challenges to shared decision-making in agile software development: alignment of strategic product plans with iteration plans, allocation of development resources, and performing development and maintenance tasks in teams. Conclusion Agile software development requires alignment of decisions on the strategic, tactical, and operational levels in order to overcome these challenges. Agile development also requires a transition from specialized skills to redundancy of functions and from rational to naturalistic decision-making. This takes time; the case companies needed from one to two years to change from traditional, hierarchical decision-making to shared decision-making in software development projects."

The emergence of different process support paradigms and the lack of methods for comparing existing approaches enabling \{PAIS\} changes have made the selection of adequate process management technology difficult. This paper suggests a set of 18 change patterns and seven change support features to foster the systematic comparison of existing process management technology in respect to process change support. While the proposed patterns are all based on empirical evidence from several large case studies, the suggested change support features constitute typical functionalities provided by flexible PAISs. Based on the proposed change patterns and features, we provide a detailed analysis and evaluation of selected approaches from both academia and industry. The presented work will not only facilitate the selection of technologies for realizing flexible PAISs, but can also be used as a reference for implementing flexible PAISs."

With the time new requirement are coming so a change oriented technique is needed. In this paper a change oriented adaptive software engineering model is presented that use an agile methodology: CFDD (cognizant feature driven development). In this model changes are handled separately from the development phase. Two techniques are used in combination: Adaptive development and CFDD (an Agile methodology).

738.0,Excluded,ec3,Changes and change management in construction and \{IT\} projects,"Modelling for change management in construction might benefit from experiences from other industries. This study compares reasons for change as well as change practices in interorganizational relationships in construction and information technology. Sixteen contractual relationships have been studied through a questionnaire and interview survey conducted among both clients and providers. Project-type relations are contrasted with more continuous service support contracts. More than their providers, clients tend to ascribe high change frequencies to an increase in technical understanding during projects. Early provider participation is associated with lower change frequencies, while the strength of incentives is less influential. The ease of transforming changes into new projects varies between technologies. Irreversibility is important, as well as relations between pre-investigations and the successive revealing of initial conditions, together with the life-cycle of formal and informal communication.

We envision an environment in which relay networks are dynamically formed when performance on the radio access network is degraded and then dissolved when the performance improves or the radio spectrum on which the relay network is operating is reclaimed. Each relay network operates on a different frequency band. Likewise, a relay network may channelize its frequency band to offer non-interfering links among the mobile nodes within a single relay network. We propose a set of algorithms used to form such relay networks on-demand. Each algorithm provides a simple and distributed frequency assignment scheme. We also propose two enhancements to improve network throughput of resulting relay networks. We evaluate these algorithms in terms of the overhead of the relay network formation. The evaluation results show that having nodes outmost from the \{BS\} initiate route discovery first is the best approach for reducing the formation overhead. The results also show that there is a large increase in throughput when using multiple frequencies in a relay network. Further, the performance of the network using multiple frequencies based on our simple frequency assignment is very close to that of a network using optimal frequency assignment."
769.0,Included,included,Chapter 12 - Agile Architecting: Enabling the Delivery of Complex Agile Systems Development Projects,"Abstract This chapter looks at the delivery of large, complex system development projects that typically require the development and integration of multiple systems and the coordination of hundreds of individuals. We argue that traditional agile development techniques that persuade against the use of architectures and processes can fail or provide suboptimal delivery in such situations. It is argued that elements of software, infrastructure, and data architecture are necessary prerequisites for the successful delivery of complex agile system development projects. The chapter suggests that these architectural elements should be identified in each project via a risk-based approach. These resulting architecture elements can then be used by a distributed low-cost delivery organization to reduce rework within the agile software development process and accelerate delivery by maximizing the overall delivery pipeline. The chapter argues that this agile architecting technique successfully enables the low-cost and low-risk delivery of complex agile system development projects."

784.0,Included,included,Chapter 15 - Rapid \{CD\} and Other Methodologies,"Publisher Summary It is noted that the phases of rapid contextual design can be broken up into three fundamental partsâ€”namely, requirements gathering, work or activity redesign, and user experience design. These phases effectively maps well to any corporate or agile methodology particularly for basic requirements gathering, including business case, product or system requirements gathering, and personas and user scenarios. Rapid \{CD\} can easily supplement the deliverables required for the business analysis and requirements phases of most corporate processes. Paper prototyping is widely accepted as a means of testing design ideas and refining them. However, it should be accomplished with real user cases and not the canned test scenarios of some usability testing. The core of rapid \{CD\} is getting customer data and its implications into the design process and into the minds of designer and developers. It provides the data that is needed to guide business decisions, prioritize requirements, and produce high quality user experience. It is noted that rapid \{CD\} can augment other methods also."

Over the decades the agile community has devised several strategies and tools to help teams learn the craft of authoring better user stories. The most basic tool is the \{INVEST\} test, where the most important elements are independent, estimate, small, and testable. There is also a simple hierarchy of epics, themes, and stories to structure the conversation when a story proves far too large.

From our literature research and experience, we have constructed three axes on which the architectural decision process of projects or companies can be projected. We evaluate this framework with five industrial case studies in which we have participated. In all of the cases, the differences between two points in time (phases) were evaluated. These differences helped us identify what aspects influence the efficiency of the project/company. The presented Triple-A Framework can be used in other projects to help locate places where the architectural process can be improved when the agility of a project changes."
832.0,Included,included,Chapter 5 - Deriving Initial Project Backlogs,"An initial project backlog of user stories is essential to getting an agile warehousing project started. Stories on the initial backlog should come from the product owner and sometimes a couple of other key user groups. Since the initial backlog allows project estimation, and estimation in turn supports project funding, these stories often have to be gathered before Iteration 0 of the sprint and before the full team is assigned. A project architect is a good choice for leading this preproject effort. He should declare an Iteration âˆ’1 to create the time to gather the initial project backlog. In addition to that backlog, the architect will also want to derive from the initial interviews a business target model of the fact and dimensional entities needed to solve the product ownerâ€™s analytical problem. This model will support later the work of the data architect and systems analysts during the projectâ€™s Iteration 0.

The user stories must be broken down one step further into â€œdeveloper stories.â€� The primary means of identifying developer stories for a project is to intersect each user story with the macro data architecture of the application being built. Teams can determine whether the resulting work units are right sized by using a variation on Scrumâ€™s \{INVEST\} test. Developer stories should be demonstrable, independent, layered, business valuable, estimatable, refinable, testable, and smallâ€”a combination known as DILBERTâ€™S test. Teams can subdivide developer stories that are still too large along distinct row sets, column sets, column types, and specialty tables. The overarching goal is to define work units of a consistent size so that a team can optimize its delivery process.

851.0,Included,included,Chapter 7 - Continuous Software Architecture Analysis,"Abstract This chapter discusses software architecture analysis in the context of agile processes. Agile processes are characterized by incremental and interleaved activities and by a focus on continuous improvement and delivery. Most approaches to software architecture analysis, however, have been developed to be performed at dedicated points in the development process or as external evaluation activities and not as continuous activities throughout the development process. This chapter discusses continuous software architecture analysis (CSAA). It reviews important requirements for \{CSAA\} and outlines how \{CSAA\} is supported by current software architecture analysis approaches. It further presents experiences with an approach for continuous structural and conformance analysis and identifies future research challenges."
863.0,Included,included,Chapter 9 - Bridging User Stories and Software Architecture: A Tailored Scrum for Agile Architecting,"Abstract Agile architecting is a key issue to scale agile to develop large software systems. This chapter describes a set of mechanisms that make agile architecting feasible. These mechanisms are smoothly integrated in a tailored Scrum for agile architecting by (1) defining product requirements in terms of features by using feature pools and feature trees to provide the portfolio and roadmap visions of a product, (2) designing highly flexible architecture called working architecture, (3) bridging user stories and software architecture through features and design decisions as traceability mechanisms, and (4) systematically assisting agile practitioners by conducting change impact analysis of features through various iterations of the agile process. This tailored Scrum for agile architecting has been successfully put into practice to develop several projects, which have been deployed in a software factory set up in collaboration between the Technical University of Madrid (UPM) and the company Indra. In this chapter, one of these projects is used to illustrate how this tailored Scrum has been applied and how it can be adopted."
876.0,Excluded,ec7,Characteristics of New Requirements in the Presence or Absence of an Existing System Architecture,"While much research attention has been paid to transitioning from requirements to software architectures, relatively little attention has been paid to how new requirements are affected by an existing system architecture. Specifically, no scientific studies have been conducted on the ""characteristic"" differences between the newly elicited requirements gathered in the presence or absence of an existing software architecture. This paper describes an exploratory controlled study investigating such requirements characteristics. We found that a multitude of characteristics (e.g., end-user focus, technological focus, and importance) were affected by the presence or absence of an SA, and the extent of this effect. The study results have implications for: RE process engineering, post-requirements analysis, and future empirical work in RE based on emergent hypotheses from this study."
877.0,Excluded,ec3,Characterization and optimization of image quality as a function of reconstruction algorithms and parameter settings in a Siemens Inveon small-animal \{PET\} scanner using the \{NEMA\} \{NU\} 4-2008 standards,"The image reconstruction algorithms provided with the Siemens Inveon small-animal \{PET\} scanner are filtered backprojection (FBP), 3-dimensional reprojection (3DRP), ordered subset expectation maximization in 2 or 3 dimensions (OSEM2D/3D) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) reconstruction. This study aimed at optimizing the reconstruction parameter settings with regard to image quality (IQ) as defined by the \{NEMA\} \{NU\} 4-2008 standards. The \{NEMA\} \{NU\} 4-2008 image quality phantom was used to determine image noise, expressed as percentage standard deviation in the uniform phantom region (%STDunif), activity recovery coefficients for the FDG-filled rods (RCrod), and spill-over ratios for the non-radioactive water- and air-filled phantom compartments (SORwat and SORair). Although not required by \{NEMA\} \{NU\} 4, we also determined a contrast-to-noise ratio for each rod (CNRrod), expressing the trade-off between activity recovery and image noise. For \{FBP\} and 3DRP the cut-off frequency of the applied filters, and for \{OSEM2D\} and OSEM3D, the number of iterations was varied. For MAP, the â€œsmoothing parameterâ€� Î² and the type of uniformity constraint (variance or resolution) were varied. Results of these analyses were demonstrated in images of an FDG-injected rat showing tumours in the liver, and of a mouse injected with an 18F-labeled peptide, showing a small subcutaneous tumour and the cortex structure of the kidneys. Optimum \{IQ\} in terms of \{CNRrod\} for the small-diameter rods was obtained using \{MAP\} with uniform variance and Î²=0.4. This setting led to RCrod,1&#xa0;mm=0.21, RCrod,2&#xa0;mm=0.57, %STDunif=1.38, SORwat=0.0011, and SORair=0.00086. However, the highest activity recovery for the smallest rods with still very small %STDunif was obtained using Î²=0.075, for which these \{IQ\} parameters were 0.31, 0.74, 2.67, 0.0041, and 0.0030, respectively. The different settings of reconstruction parameters were clearly reflected in the rat and mouse images as the trade-off between the recovery of small structures (blood vessels, small tumours, kidney cortex structure) and image noise in homogeneous body parts (healthy liver background). Highest \{IQ\} for the Inveon \{PET\} scanner was obtained using \{MAP\} reconstruction with uniform variance. The setting of Î² depended on the specific imaging goals."
878.0,Excluded,ec7,Characterization of Functional Software Requirements Space: The Law of Requirements Taxonomic Growth,"This paper reports on a large-scale empirical multiple-case study that aimed to characterize the requirements space in the domain of web-based Enterprise Systems (ES). Results from this study, among others, showed that, on the average, about 85% of all the software functionalities in the studied domain are specified using a small core set of five requirements classes even though the results of the study hint at a larger set of nine requirements classes that should be covered. The study also uncovered a law describing the growth pattern of the emerging requirements classes in software domains. According to this law, the emergence of the classes in a requirements taxonomic scheme for a particular domain, independent of the order in which specifications of requirements in that domain are analyzed, includes a rapid initial growth phase, where the majority of the requirements classes are identified, followed by a rapid slow-down phase with periods of no growth (i.e., the stabilization phase)."

Current functionality has arisen from modelling in the fields of cancer, cardiac physiology and soft-tissue mechanics. It is released under the \{LGPL\} 2.1 licence. Chaste has been developed using agile programming methods. The project began in 2005 when it was reasoned that the modelling of a variety of physiological phenomena required both a generic mathematical modelling framework, and a generic computational/simulation framework. The Chaste project evolved from the Integrative Biology (IB) e-Science Project, an inter-institutional project aimed at developing a suitable \{IT\} infrastructure to support physiome-level computational modelling, with a primary focus on cardiac and cancer modelling.

883.0,Excluded,ec3,Classification and trend analysis of UML books (1997–2009),"Technical books of each subject area denote the level of maturity and knowledge demand in that area. According to the Google Books database, about 208 Unified Modeling Language (UML) books have been published from its inception in 1997 until 2009. While various book reviews are frequently published in various sources (e.g., IEEE Software Bookshelf), there are no studies to classify UML books into meaningful categories. Such a classification can help researchers in the area to identify trends and also reveal the level of activity in each sub-area of UML. The statistical survey reported in this article intends to be a first step in classification and trend analysis of the UML books published from 1997 to 2009. The study also sheds light on the quantity of books published in different focus areas (e.g., UML’s core concepts, patterns, tool support, Object Constraint Language and Model-Driven Architecture) and also on different application domains (e.g., database modeling, web applications, and real-time systems). The trends of book publications in each sub-area of UML are also used to track the level of maturity, to identify possible Hype cycles and also to measure knowledge demand in each area."
884.0,Excluded,ec3,Classification of tasks using machine learning,"Categorizing software engineering artifacts, tasks in our case, is often a prerequisite for analysis and research. As an example, categorizing tasks according to their activity allows for a post-mortem analysis of the life cycle model of a project and can be used as a foundation for software metrics. Many categorical attributes of software artifacts are often not entered correctly or are not entered at all. For example, we observed a significant number of obsolete tasks that were not categorized as such.In this paper, we present an approach for the automatic classification of tasks in software development projects using machine learning. We evaluated our technique by two sample applications from the domain of project management: Tasks are classified according to activity and relevance, respectively. Project-relevant characteristics are learned by the classifier from the project history. Five-fold cross-validation of both applications resulted in classification accuracies of 80.51% (six categories) and 83.72% (two categories). Our approach is also applicable to other types of artifacts and categorizations within a unified software engineering model."
885.0,Excluded,ec3,Clearing the RF smog: making 802.11n robust to cross-technology interference,"Recent studies show that high-power cross-technology interference is becoming a major problem in today's 802.11 networks. Devices like baby monitors and cordless phones can cause a wireless LAN to lose connectivity. The existing approach for dealing with such high-power interferers makes the 802.11 network switch to a different channel; yet the ISM band is becoming increasingly crowded with diverse technologies, and hence many 802.11 access points may not find an interference-free channel.This paper presents TIMO, a MIMO design that enables 802.11n to communicate in the presence of high-power cross-technology interference. Unlike existing MIMO designs, however, which require all concurrent transmissions to belong to the same technology, TIMO can exploit MIMO capabilities to decode in the presence of a signal from a different technology, hence enabling diverse technologies to share the same frequency band. We implement a prototype of TIMO in GNURadio-USRP2 and show that it enables 802.11n to communicate in the presence of interference from baby monitors, cordless phones, and microwave ovens, transforming scenarios with a complete loss of connectivity to operational networks."

But how does one conduct regular, quality client research with limited staff? In this paper, we describe five approaches to client research undertaken by our small unit within University of Washington Information Technology. Our unit identifies, develops, and supports technologies and services for faculty, students, researchers, and staff on three campuses. We strive to understand client needs and to incorporate client feedback into our software and service production life cycle.

We also offer suggestions for effectively engaging staff and clients in the research effort and for maximizing the benefits that result."

Justifications for incremental approaches include risk amelioration, the management of evolving requirements, and end-user involvement. Incremental development, including iterative, incremental delivery, has become a norm in many sectors. However, there has been little work on modelling the effort in such development and hence a dearth of comparative analyses of cost models for incremental development/delivery. We attempt to rectify this by proposing a COCOMO-style effort model for incremental development/delivery and explore the relationship between effort and the number of increments, thereby providing new insights into the economic impact of incremental approaches to software projects."
888.0,Excluded,ec3,Cognitive radio architecture evolution: annals of telecommunications,"Cognitive radio research has developed dynamic radio spectrum management to enhance spectrum efficiency, e.g., as secondary users in unused TV bands. The location and user context of the mobile wireless user that regulatory bodies and lawmakers view as significant to spectrum interference policies have not been addressed as thoroughly. In addition, quality of service (QoS) provides a starting point but does not guarantee quality of experience (QoE) that depends on quality of information (QoI) which is a function of place, time, and user state in a social setting (e.g., commuting, shopping, or in need of medical assistance). This paper considers the evolution of cognitive radio architecture (CRA) from dynamic spectrum access (DSA) to QoE via an interdisciplinary perspective. Machine perception in visual, acoustic, speech, and text domains can cue the automatic detection of user state in stereotypical situations, enabling cognitive nodes and networks to select from among radio bands and modes more appropriately, thus enabling cognitive wireless networks (CWNs) to deliver higher QoE within technical policy constraints, in a way that makes cost-effective use of embedded and distributed computational intelligence. The control of networks of such cognitive radios requires advances in policy language architectures, so this paper introduces cognitive linguistics for policy languages."

We present our philosophy, collaboration across the curriculum, which moves beyond existing individual courses or course units to teach collaboration skills in a pervasive manner. In our approach, concepts are introduced and skills are developed throughout the computer science curriculum---from CS1 to a capstone experience. Students are provided with opportunities to exercise skills in reflective environments that eventually mirror real-world experiences, and technical course content is not compromised.We argue for this system and provide details about how collaboration across the curriculum is accomplished at a small liberal arts college."
890.0,Excluded,ec3,Collaboration and co-ordination in mature eXtreme programming teams,"Mature eXtreme programming (XP) teams are highly collaborative and self-organising. In previous studies, we have observed that these teams rely on two apparently simple mechanisms of co-ordination and collaboration: story cards and the Wall. Story cards capture and embody the user stories which form the basis of implementation, while the Wall is a physical space used to organise and display the cards being implemented during the current development cycle (called an iteration). In this paper, we analyse the structure and use of story cards and the Wall in three mature \{XP\} teams, using a distributed cognition approach. The teams work in different commercial organisations developing different systems, yet we find significant similarities between their use of these two artefacts. Although simple, teams use the cards and the Wall in sophisticated ways to represent and communicate information that is vital to support their activities. We discuss the significance of the physical medium for the story cards and the Wall in an \{XP\} team and discuss the considerations that need to be taken into account for the design of technology to support the teams."

894.0,Included,included,Collaborative Events and Shared Artefacts: Agile Interaction Designers and Developers Working Toward Common Aims,"Agile processes emphasize collaboration. We were interested in studying collaboration in agile teams including interaction designers, since the integration of user interaction design processes and software development processes is still an open issue. This study focused on designer and developer collaborations in the early stages of project work at four workplaces. We found designer-developer collaborations were extensive and we developed a categorization scheme of collaboration forms and artefacts that support this relationship. While some designer-developer collaborations were directed towards planning, which has been extensively researched, a larger part was directed towards realignment work. This latter type of collaborative work took three basic forms: scheduled, impromptu, and chats. Regardless of the form of collaboration, designer-developer interactions were mediated by twelve categories of artefacts. These artefacts helped designers and developers to determine, more specifically, what to create. We discuss the implications of our observations on alignment work for theory and practice."

The WWAN typically provides much wider coverage but much lower speeds than the WLAN. To address this dichotomy, we present COMBINE, a system for collaborative downloading wherein devices that are within WLAN range pool together their WWAN links, significantly increasing the effective speed available to them.COMBINE makes a number of novel contributions overprior work in this area, including: (a) a framework of incentives for collaboration that addresses several practical issues including the unification of monetary and energy costs, and on-the-fly estimation of the energy cost of communication in a system in operation; (b) a protocol for collaborative group formation and workload distribution that is energy efficient and adaptive to fluctuations in network conditions; and (c) an application-level striping procedure that eases deployment by avoiding the need for special-purpose proxies in the infrastructure. We present experimental results based on the prototype we have implemented that showen couraging speeds-ups with COMBINE."

899.0,Included,included,Combining systematic reuse with Agile development: experience report,"This paper documents the experiences of Siemens Healthcare in mastering challenges when transitioning a large-scale dispersed platform development organization to Agile. Product Line Engineering aims at increasing productivity through reuse, but since strategic reuse requires up-front decisions, is also seen as heavy weight and process driven. Agile development on the other hand is perceived as lightweight, change friendly, but at the same time neglecting long term strategic planning. With this paper we want to report on our experience combining both approaches, PLE for strategic reuse and agile principles for achieving steady progress while still leveraging the long-term benefits. The key was to build the foundation on the common best practice of 'feature-orientation' present in flavors in both disciplines. Feature-orientation allowed merging both disciplines into a holistic approach that blends the benefits of product line engineering with those of Agility -- resulting in improved product delivery, as well as employee and customer satisfaction."

Literature and practice have shown that commitment to SPI at all organizational levels is essential for the success of any SPI endeavor. A research model for studying the existence, development and interplay of SPI-related commitment is introduced in this paper. This study suggests that software organizations operate through strategic, operational and personal commitment nets. These nets consist of actors, drivers, concerns, actions, commitment, and outcomes. The commitment nets model is applied in a study of four industrial SPI initiatives. The results from two of these cases are reported here. The results show that SPI is driven through the formation and reformation of commitment nets. The contents of strategic, operational and personal commitment nets are laid out and implications are discussed."

Drawing on concepts from organizational theory, we describe an approach for studying co-ordination activity in software engineering and the application of this approach to two real-world software projects.

The speed offered by Agile Software Development is needed for short time to market, while reuse strategies such as Software Product Line Engineering are needed for long-term productivity, efficiency, and profit. The paper investigates, through a survey, communication factors affecting both speed and reuse in 3 large companies developing embedded systems and employing Agile Software Development and Software Product Line Engineering. Our results include a prioritized list of communication related factors obtained by statistical analysis and the recognition and spread of the factors in the companies. We have recognized 5 interfaces with the Agile development team that need to be improved: system engineers (architects), product management, distributed teams, inter-project teams and sales unit. Few factors (involving inter-project communication) depend on the business drivers for the company. We also reveal that Agile teams need strategic and architectural inputs in order to be implanted in a large company employing Software Product Line Engineering. Academic and industrial training as well as different tactics for co-location would improve the communication skills of engineers. There is also a need for solutions, in the reference architecture, for fostering Agile Software Development: the goal is the combination of the focus on customer value of the teams, reusability, system requirements and avoidance of organizational dependencies."
904.0,Included,included,Communication patterns of agile requirements engineering,"An agile software development team relies on communication and collaboration to perform requirements engineering activities, rather than on dedicated analysis tools or documentation. Evidence from practice indicates that two simple physical artefacts (story cards and the wall), used in a particular and disciplined manner, and supported by appropriate social activity, are key to the success of co-located agile teams. However, little is known about this social activity or how communication and collaboration supports requirements activities in this setting. This paper reports an empirical study of a commercial agile team to investigate this issue. Using a combination of qualitative data collection and cognitive analysis techniques, we found evidence of gathering, evolving and clarifying requirements that are managed through patterns of communication. These patterns suggest that a form of situated conceptualization, which we have termed 'shared conceptualization', underpins the team's requirements engineering activities."

Agile methods have several benefits over traditional plan-based methods, in particular their ability to handle projects where requirements are not fixed. In the last few years, a number of agile software development methods have been developed but a detailed evaluation (which is essential) of these methods is not available. This paper presents a detailed comparative analysis of two well known agile methods (XP and Scrum), using the previously published 4- Dimensional Analytical Tool (4-DAT), based on four characterization perspectives: those of scope, agility, agile values and software process. A report generated with the help of 4-DAT will assist organizations in making decisions about the selection or adoption of an agile method."

937.0,Excluded,ec3,Comparison of offensive agility techniques in Australian Rules football,"Agility skill is important in Australian Rules football (ARF) as it enables an attacking player to successfully evade an opponent. To date, no research has examined offensive agility techniques in ARF. There were two purposes of this study: first, to compare the change of direction (COD) speed of three offensive agility techniques, and second, compare the reaction speed and accuracy when observing the same techniques from a defensive perspective. The techniques included the side-step, shuffle, and split-step. Seventeen players from an Australian Football League club were required to perform four trials of each technique. \{COD\} speed was expressed as a total time, and divided into entry, foot plant preparation, and exit time. In addition, nineteen players from the same club were assessed on a video-based reaction test. Players were required to respond by depressing a thumb switch to indicate whether the player on screen changed direction to the left or right. From an offensive perspective, the split-step foot plant preparation time (0.66&#xa0;s) was significantly slower than both the side-step (0.7&#xa0;s) and shuffle (0.75&#xa0;s) (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05), but there were no significant differences in entry and exit times between techniques. From a defensive perspective, the players were significantly slower and less accurate when reacting to the player in the video performing the split-step (0.19&#xa0;s) and shuffle (0.15&#xa0;s) compared to the side-step (0.12&#xa0;s) (p&#xa0;&lt;&#xa0;0.05). In a one-on-one situation in ARF, the split-step may be the most effective offensive technique. Not only was it slower and less accurate to react to, the exit speed following the change in direction was not significantly slower than the side-step. However, a performer would need to consider the cost of a slower foot plant preparation time versus the potential to deceive an opponent when under time stress."

This paper describes two different semester-long projects in which substantial change was enforced upon the students by making them develop a system that had to work on three different user interface platforms (text-based console, desktop Windows, and a mobile Pocket PC). By making the students plan and adapt for this change the students were better able to truly appreciate the benefits of good design and were willing to take the extra effort to implement a design that reflects the principles taught in most object-oriented design courses. One of the key principles engaged by this approach was the importance of a layered architecture to software projects driven by change. Â© 2008 EDSIG."
939.0,Included,included,Complex software project development: Agile methods adoption,"The Agile Software Development paradigm has become increasingly popular in the last few years, since it claims lower costs, better productivity, better quality and better business satisfaction. Supply chain management (SCM) is a complex software development project. Owing to its scope and uncertain, complex and unstable requirements, it is not possible to develop it with predictable software development process models. Agile methodologies are targeted toward such kinds of problems that involve change and uncertainty, and are adaptive rather than predictive. How an agile process is introduced will significantly impact the implementation success of the process change. The objective of this paper is to analyze the agile development methodologies and management approach used in developing a complex software project. This further demonstrates how to overcome risks and barriers in each development phase of such complex inventive software projects. It also provides a set of guidelines regarding how the agile methodologies can be adopted, combined and used in these kinds of complex software projects. These findings have implications for software engineers and managers developing software by agile methods. Â© 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
940.0,Excluded,ec7,Compliance Analysis Based on a Goal-oriented Requirement Language Evaluation Methodology,"In recent years, many governmental regulations have been introduced to protect the privacy of personal information. As a result, organizations must take a systematic approach to ensure that their business processes comply with these regulations. In the past, we introduced a requirements framework that mapped regulations documents and goals to goal and scenario models of organizational processes. The intent was to help organizations document and manage the compliance of their processes in the face of evolutionary changes. In this paper, we extend our framework by incorporating regulation scenario models and by adding the notion of contribution link level to the compliance link types. These extensions result in a frame-work that is more aligned to the needs of an organization when it must evaluate and ensure the legal compliance of its organizational processes."

The working domain expert looks for intuitive metamodeling features. In particular, these features include rich capabilities for specifying the visual appearance of models. Our research has identified an important design rationale for metamodeling tools that we call visual reification, which is the notion that metamodels are visualized the same way as their instances. Our tool supports both standard and innovative metamodeling features oriented towards the principle of visual reification. In this paper we present an unbiased discussion of the pragmatics of metamodeling tools against the background of this design rationale."

Although agile software development represents a major approach to software engineering, there is no well-established conceptual definition and sound methodological support of agile release scheduling. Objective To propose a solution, we present, (1) a conceptual model for agile scheduling, and (2) a novel multiple knapsack-based optimization model with (3) a branch-and-bound optimization algorithm for agile release scheduling. Method To evaluate our model simulations were carried out seven real life and several generated data sets. Results The developed algorithm strives to prevent resource overload and resource underload, and mitigates risks of delivery slippage. Conclusion The results of the experiment suggest that this approach can provide optimized semi-automatic release schedule generations and more informed and established decisions utilizing what-if-analysis on the fly to tailor the best schedule for the specific project context."
945.0,Excluded,ec3,Concurrent product data modeling for collaborative design environments,"A deductive approach to design has served the era of evolutionary changes well. However, many recent design projects are requiring more of an evolutionary jump. These projects demand more resources and more learning over large collaborating organizations to produce results. This paper will discuss elements such as large scale collaboration, flexibility, and shared understanding among designers in the context of a design process for complex physical systems. It is proposed that these qualities can be achieved through the use of a well conceived computer framework which implements several tools and techniques used in the software development industry. These techniques include the use of logical abstractions, distributed revision control, service oriented architectures, and Unit testing. These particular techniques have been extracted as key features that enable developers to successfully produce products while working collaboratively across organizational and cultural barriers. It is believed that this combination of tools will enhance the design process of physical systems by addressing the deficiencies required by new projects that call for evolutionary jumps and by creating learning opportunities for designers which could benefit the whole in terms of problem definition and solution development."

Pair programming is supposed to be a practice suitable for this purpose. Unfortunately, the building of tacit knowledge is determined by factors that are difficult to isolate and capture because they concern personal attitude and capability. Thus, we have focused on the possible causes forming the individual ability, that can be isolated and studied, such as the individual education background. We have applied the practice of working in pairs to the design phase. We have made an experiment and a replica in academic environment, in order to understand the relationship between the building of knowledge through the practice and the individual background. In this paper we discuss the replica and compare the results with the first experiment's ones."

951.0,Excluded,ec7,Context Analysis Method for Embedded Systems — Exploring a Requirement Boundary Between a System and Its Context,"Many embedded systems not only affect their context through actuators but also are affected by the context through sensors. It is important to provide a context-dependent development method for constructing safe and reliable embedded systems. However, most of the current requirements analysis methods do not explicitly provide a systematic way for deciding the boundary of the context that should be taken into account because it is essentially difficult to decide which context element should be included as the targets of requirements analysis. If a developer explores the context boundary in an ad-hoc manner, he or she will be faced with the frame problem because there are unlimited context elements in the real world where the target system exists. To deal with this problem, this paper proposes a context-dependent requirements analysis method called CAMEmb (Context Analysis Method for Embedded systems) in which only the value-context elements are extracted as the associated context elements. Applying the guide words provided by CAMEmb, we can explore only a sequence of context elements directly or indirectly affecting the data value observed or controlled by the system sensors and actuators. Other context elements not affecting the system observation and control are not taken into account because these context elements do not affect the system behavior. Using CAMEmb and lightweight formal tools, we can explore the context boundary that guarantees the expected system behavior. We developed CAMEmbModeler, a support tool consisting of a CAMEmb-based modeling editor and a model compiler that transforms system and context models into the design model reflecting the context boundary."

Contextual information not only facilitates improved applications, but can also become significant security parameters -- which in turn can potentially ensure service delivery not to anyone anytime anywhere, but to the right person at the right time and place. Specially, in determining access control to resources, contextual information can play an important role. Access control models, as studied in traditional computing security, however, have no notion of context-awareness; and the recent works in the nascent field of context-aware access control predominantly focus on spatio-temporal contexts, disregarding a host of other pertinent contexts. In this paper, with a view to exploring the relationship of access control and context-awareness in ubiquitous computing, we propose a comprehensive context-aware access control model for ubiquitous healthcare services. We explain the design, implementation and evaluation of the proposed model in detail. We chose healthcare a representative application domain because healthcare systems pose an array of non-trivial context-sensitive access control requirements, many of which are directly or indirectly applicable to other context-aware ubiquitous computing applications."

954.0,Excluded,ec3,Continuous SCRUM: agile management of SAAS products,"Hosted software-as-a-service products provide an opportunity to provide consumers with continuous deployment of new features, as opposed to scheduled version upgrades as is the norm for products installed on-premise. In order to exploit this opportunity, a SaaS provider needs to adopt an agile process that is capable of releasing new features rapidly. The SCRUM [5,6] process is ideally suited for this purpose: However, when SCRUM has been used for agile development of an installed product, parallel, overlapping 'sprints' are executed by separate teams, each dealing with short, medium, and longer-term enhancements to the product[3]; with the result that version upgrades are therefore easier to manage. In contrast, in the case of a SAAS product, version upgrades are no longer a constraint, so we can do better. In this paper we describe 'Continuous SCRUM', a variant of Type-C SCRUM, augmented with engineering best practices, in a manner ideally suited for managing SAAS products. In our approach, bug-fixes, minor enhancements, as well as major features are released continuously, on a weekly basis by a single team, in contrast to ""Meta-SCRUM"" [3]. We also present field data from our experience with using Continuous SCRUM for a hosted platform-as-a-service product for more than two years. Our experience reinforces other recent evidence [11] that rapid, smaller releases are often preferable to infrequent, larger ones. Continuous SCRUM provides a mechanism to achieve and sustain a rapid release cycle, for SAAS products as well as, we believe, for custom applications developed in-house."
955.0,Excluded,ec3,Contract driven development = test driven development - writing test cases,"Although unit tests are recognized as an important tool in software development, programmers prefer to write code, rather than unit tests. Despite the emergence of tools like JUnit which automate part of the process, unit testing remains a time-consuming, resource-intensive, and not particularly appealing activity.This paper introduces a new development method, called Contract Driven Development. This development method is based on a novel mechanism that extracts test cases from failure-producing runs that the programmers trigger. It exploits actions that developers perform anyway as part of their normal process of writing code. Thus, it takes the task of writing unit tests off the developers' shoulders, while still taking advantage of their knowledge of the intended semantics and structure of the code. The approach is based on the presence of contracts in code, which act as the oracle of the test cases. The test cases are extracted completely automatically, are run in the background, and can easily be maintained over versions. The tool implementing this methodology is called Cdd and is available both in binary and in source form."

The literature review section reveals the need and scope for more research on lean design. We also enunciate how the lean design approach fits within the traditional product design and development process, and then evaluate \{TRIZ\} and \{AD\} for their contributions to leanness. Our evaluation reveals a close correlation between these tools and the lean design metrics. The paper concludes by proposing the use of a synergistic problem solving approach based on \{TRIZ\} and \{AD\} to increase efficiency and quality of the process while also helping to achieve lean design goals for a company."

958.0,Excluded,ec3,Converged ‘user integration’ provided as a mediated service,"In the world of machine-to-machine interaction, the success of Web Services technology owes much to its ability to define a contract between applications independent of the host machines’ underlying hardware and the transport mechanism linking them. With this contract, applications know what to expect of one another and this provides a solid foundation for integration. The resulting business process improvements translate directly into saved costs and new business opportunities. However, these workflow improvements typically come to a grinding halt whenever real-time input from consumers is required since there is currently no way to effectively construct the same sort of contract for spontaneous person-tomachine interactions as Web Services provides for machine-to-machine interaction. The consumer-to-machine link is characterised by reliability, availability, trust and conformance to message syntax all being in unbearable deficit … and all of that deficit being due to the user ‘component’ rather than the machine! For this reason, the solution designer will typically consider the user to be effectively unavailable and ‘park’ the workflow in a suitable state pending user intervention at some later date. If a mechanism were available to transform the user into a reliable, highly available, trusted component of the overall workflow system which always rendered its requests/responses in machine-readable form to an agreed syntax then that ‘component’ (the user) could be included in automated processes directly. This integration of the user into the workflow would have far-reaching impact on the way systems are designed and operated, providing the user with much greater control of service delivery and improving the overall service experience.This paper describes a prototype system and how the operator of such a system can support users employing a multitude of devices connected over various networks and offer to third parties a facility whereby they can very easily conduct structured interactions with those users in real time, on the device of their preference, without them requiring any knowledge of those users’ devices, addresses, networks, presence or device preferences. The users are restricted to supplying only valid messages which are forwarded to the third party in machine-readable format in order that their service logic can act on them automatically. The paper goes on to propose further opportunities arising from the ownership of such a facility."

However, these factors are frequently overlooked when it comes to discussing the performance of CSS in cognitive radio (CR) networks. In this work we investigate the performance of a relay-based CSS approach proposed for CR applications. Specifically, we analyze the detection accuracy of a CR network considering channel impairments, amplify-and-forward relying protocol, and a selection combining scheme. First, a closed form expression for the average false alarm probability is derived. Then, the probability density function (PDF) of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is obtained and a closed-form expression for the average detection probability at high SNR applications is derived. The sensing and the reporting channels are assumed to be subjected to independent and identically distributed Rayleigh fading. The PDF approach is used in our analysis. This approach is not easily tractable as it involves higher orders of Bessel functions. However, an approximated polynomial representation of a first-order modified Bessel function of the second kind makes this task possible. The results obtained validate the derived closed form expressions and show the importance of considering reporting channel statistics and relaying mechanism for accurate performance analysis of the CSS in CR networks."
961.0,Excluded,ec3,Coordination in co-located agile software development projects,"Agile software development provides a way to organise the complex task of multi-participant software development while accommodating constant project change. Agile software development is well accepted in the practitioner community but there is little understanding of how such projects achieve effective coordination, which is known to be critical in successful software projects. A theoretical model of coordination in the agile software development context is presented based on empirical data from three cases of co-located agile software development. Many practices in these projects act as coordination mechanisms, which together form a coordination strategy. Coordination strategy in this context has three components: synchronisation, structure, and boundary spanning. Coordination effectiveness has two components: implicit and explicit. The theoretical model of coordination in agile software development projects proposes that an agile coordination strategy increases coordination effectiveness. This model has application for practitioners who want to select appropriate practices from agile methods to ensure they achieve coordination coverage in their project. For the field of information systems development, this theory contributes to knowledge of coordination and coordination effectiveness in the context of agile software development."

In previous research we proposed countermeasure graphs (CGs), an approach to conduct risk analysis, combining the ideas of different risk analysis approaches. The approach was designed for reuse and easy evolvability to support agile software development. \{CGs\} have not been evaluated in industry practice in agile software development. In this research we evaluate the ability of \{CGs\} to support practitioners in identifying the most critical threats and countermeasures. The research method used is participatory action research where \{CGs\} were evaluated in a series of risk analyses on four different telecom products. With Peltier (used prior to the use of \{CGs\} at the company) the practitioners identified attacks with low to medium risk level. \{CGs\} allowed practitioners to identify more serious risks (in the first iteration 1 serious threat, 5 high risk threats, and 11 medium threats). The need for tool support was identified very early, tool support allowed the practitioners to play through scenarios of which countermeasures to implement, and supported reuse. The results indicate that \{CGs\} support practitioners in identifying high risk security threats, work well in an agile software development context, and are cost-effective."

Although the need to tailor a software process to specific project requirements seems to be widely accepted and unquestioned, the way of doing the tailoring remains unclear and is, therefore, often left to the expertise of process engineers or project managers. What are the criteria to be applied in the tailoring? What are dependencies between different criteria and how should certain criteria influence the software process? In this paper we investigate concrete tailoring criteria for the tailoring of software processes. To this end, we present a collection of 49 tailoring criteria as the outcomes of a systematic literature review. We further analyze the impact of the discovered tailoring criteria by relating them to a set of 20 exemplary tailoring actions, which affect the project-specific software process. Our outcomes show that the factors influencing the tailoring are well understood, however, the consequences of the criteria remain abstract and need to be interpreted on a project-per-project basis."

After overcoming the initial threshold of establishing the measurement program organizations stand before the questions of which measures should be collected in order to lead to actions or at least effectively trigger decision processes. Objective The objective of this paper is to investigate how to use measures in an effective way in decision processes. This dependency is examined through a case study â€“ Ericsson in Sweden. Two models of these dependencies are recognized a priori â€“ metrics-push and metric-pull â€“ and in the study the models are used to describe how measures affect decisions and vice versa. Method The research method is a case study of the measurement program of one of the product development units of Ericsson in Sweden. The participants are carefully selected from the management teams at different levels of organizations. The objects are measures and decisions at these management levels. The instruments are interviews and observations. The results obtained at Ericsson are validated through interviews at another company â€“ \{RUAG\} Space. Results The results show that effective use of measures as evidence for decision processes does not require a large number of measures (ca. 20 at the top management level). It was found that there are four types of measures which are used in different ways in the context of decision formulation and implementation (which we call decision-measures dependency model). The critical aspects of effective measures in decision-making context are completeness, reliability and providing early warnings. It was also found that the time between the decision and when its results can be observed via measures (length of the feedback loop) is a crucial aspect determining at which organizational level a measure should be placed. Conclusions After overcoming the initial threshold of establishing measurement programs the organizations demand non-functional properties from the measures. These non-functional properties like completeness, providing early-warning or trust determine whether decision processes are triggered by measures or not."

We have developed Zelda, a prototype for associating arbitrary lines in text-based files with a feature map. This representation can be used to link together sections from many types of artifacts and can also contain annotations and notes. Zelda automatically tracks and presents the locations of these links in subsequent versions of the artifacts. We evaluated Zelda using 25 versions of jEdit, (260 KLOC).

However, this is rarely the case for new software projects and for many companies. So far, only a few have studies focused on transferring prediction models from one project to another. In this paper, we study cross-project defect prediction models on a large scale. For 12 real-world applications, we ran 622 cross-project predictions. Our results indicate that cross-project prediction is a serious challenge, i.e., simply using models from projects in the same domain or with the same process does not lead to accurate predictions. To help software engineers choose models wisely, we identified factors that do influence the success of cross-project predictions. We also derived decision trees that can provide early estimates for precision, recall, and accuracy before a prediction is attempted."
973.0,Excluded,ec7,CSSL: a logic for specifying conditional scenarios,"Scenarios and use cases are popular means of describing the intended system behaviour. They support a variety of features and, notably, allow for two different interpretations: existential and universal. These modalities allow a progressive shift from examples to general rules about the expected system behaviour. The combination of modalities in a scenario-based specification poses technical challenges when automated reasoning is to be provided. In particular, the use of conditional existential scenarios, of which use cases with preconditions are a common example, require reasoning in branching time. Yet, formally grounded approaches to requirements engineering and industrial verification approaches shy away from branching-time logics due to their relatively unintuitive semantics. In this paper, we define an extension of an (industry standard) linear-time logic with sufficient branching expressiveness to allow capturing conditional existential statements. The resulting logic, called CSSL (Conditional Scenario Specification Language), has an efficient model-checking procedure. It supports reasoning about heterogeneous requirements specifications that include universal and existential statements in the form of use cases and conditional existential scenarios, and other sequence chart variants, in addition to general (linear) liveness and safety properties. We report on two industrial case studies in which the logic was used to specify and verify scenarios and properties."

Considering that agile methodologies, in focus Framework SCRUM, are always more popular in Development Software Companies, and noticing that the mentioned companies cannot always apply every characteristics of the framework, this paper presents an hybrid application of methodologies from Verbal Decision Analysis (VDA) framework to select some of the \{SCRUM\} approaches to be applied in the company, considering the elicitation of preferences of a decision maker. The work intends to provide an evaluation of Project Management approaches applied in the Software Development and examine them toward to identify which are the most preferable ones, aided by the application of a hybrid model of decision making. The hybrid model aims at classifying alternatives using \{ORCLASS\} method, through the developed software, and ranking them using a Verbal Decision Analysis method (ZAPROS III-i). Afterward, Specific Practices (SP) of Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMi) level 2 were chosen, and approaches to attend the SP's were ranked from the most preferable to the least preferable ones, aiming to help enterprises which are not able to reach a complete \{CMMi\} qualification."

However, as they tend to change too fast, special care must be put in change management, both to satisfy customers and reduce developers load. In this paper we discuss how we deal with navigation and interaction requirements changes in a novel test-driven development approach for Web applications. We present it by indicating how it resembles and differs from ""conventional"" TDD, and showing how changes can be treated as ""first class"" objects, allowing us to automate the application changes and also to adaptively prune the test suite.

983.0,Excluded,ec3,Decision Making in Agile Development: A Focus Group Study of Decisions and Obstacles,"The process and effectiveness of decision making in agile development is critical yet poorly understood. This research examines decisions made across the four stages of the sprint cycle: Sprint Planning, Sprint Execution, Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective. A focus group was conducted with 43 agile developers and managers to determine what decisions were made at different points of the sprint cycle. The results indicate that Sprint Planning includes decisions about planning the work for the subsequent sprint, Sprint Execution includes tactical implementation and development decisions, Sprint Review includes decisions about whether the product satisfies the customer and whether future sprints should continue, and Sprint Retrospective includes decisions for improving the sprint process in future sprints. Additionally, six key obstacles to decision making were identified. This research contributes to the literature on agile software development by advancing our understanding of how these teams function by analyzing the decisions made during different points of the sprint cycle and the obstacles to these decisions."

More specifically the concept of using a decision support method known as the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is evaluated by a group of students and a group of developers and the outcome is compared to experiences from an XP case study. The results provide an indication that different practices are thought to be easier and more effective to implement in the two groups. A company considering implementing only a few practices can use this as help for deciding which practices to implement. Companies introducing all practices can use the results of this kind of method to see where more attention might be needed after or during the introduction of XP.

986.0,Included,included,Decision theoretic requirements prioritization: a two-step approach for sliding towards value realization,"Budget and schedule constraints limit the number of requirements that can be worked on for a software system and is thus necessary to select the most valuable requirements for implementation. However, selecting from a large number of requirements is a decision problem that requires negotiating with multiple stakeholders and satisficing their value propositions. In this paper I present a two-step value-based requirements prioritization approach based on TOPSIS, a decision analysis framework that tightly integrates decision theory with the process of requirements prioritization. In this two-step approach the software system is initially decomposed into high-level Minimal Marketable Features (MMFs) which the business stakeholders prioritize against business goals. Each individual MMF is further decomposed into low-level requirements/features that are primarily prioritized by the technical stakeholders. The priorities of the low-level requirements are influenced by the MMFs they belong to. This approach has been integrated into Winbook, a social-networking influenced collaborative requirements management framework and deployed for use by 10 real-client project teams for the Software Engineering project course at the University of Southern California in Fall 2012. This model allowed the clients and project teams to effectively gauge the importance of each MMF and low-level requirement and perform various sensitivity analyses and take value-informed decisions when selecting requirements for implementation."
987.0,Excluded,ec3,Declarative mocking,"Test-driven methodologies encourage testing early and often. ""Mock objects"" support this approach by allowing a component to be tested before all depended-upon components are available. Today mock objects typically reflect little to none of an object's intended functionality, which makes it difficult and error-prone for developers to test rich properties of their code. This paper presents ""declarative mocking"", which enables the creation of expressive and reliable mock objects with relatively little effort. In our approach, developers write method specifications in a high-level logical language for the API being mocked, and a constraint solver dynamically executes these specifications when the methods are invoked. In addition to mocking functionality, this approach seamlessly allows data and other aspects of the environment to be easily mocked. We have implemented the approach as an extension to an existing tool for executable specifications in Java called PBnJ. We have performed an exploratory study of declarative mocking on several existing Java applications, in order to understand the power of the approach and to categorize its potential benefits and limitations. We also performed an experiment to port the unit tests of several open-source applications from a widely used mocking library to PBnJ. We found that more than half of these unit tests can be enhanced, in terms of the strength of properties and coverage, by exploiting executable specifications, with relatively little additional developer effort."

However, the literature records several instances where development teams have argued for the naturalness of, and need for, planned design. This paper describes two experimental studies that compared both approaches regarding product quality and programmer productivity. Results from both studies show that (1) there is no significant difference of product quality, independently of the subjects' experience, but (2) novices are more productive when allowed to use planned design."

This work investigates in an empirical study the typical defect type distributions in current NL requirement specifications. For this study, more than 5,800 review-protocol-entries that originate from reviews of real automotive specifications according to a quality-model were categorized by us at MercedesBenz. As a result, we obtained (a) a typical defect type distribution in NL specifications in the automotive domain, (b) correlations of quality criteria to defect severity, (c) indicators on ease of handling quality criteria in the review-process and (d) information on time needed for defect correction with respect to quality criteria. To validate the findings from the data analysis, we additionally conducted 15 interviews with quality managers. The results confirm quantitatively that the most critical and important quality criteria in the investigated NL requirement specifications are consistency, completeness, and correctness."

Although the analytical domains vary greatly (e.g., seismic processing,, geologic modeling, engineering facilities design, etc.), the requirements that shape their software architectures are similar. Such analysis systems are rarely illustrated in the software analysis/design and architecture literature.We describe a product line software architecture,SALSA (Scientific Analysis System Layers Architecture), developed at ExxonMobil's Upstream Technical Computing Organization. Key forces that led to the SALSA include the data analysis process itself, the need to access data stored in a variety of formats, integrating our analysis tools with third party tools, and isolating our codes from external changes. Although derived from Layers software architectures described in the literature, we have elaboratedSALSA to identify objects within each layer specific to an architecture focussed on analysisSALSA is a product of a software development cultural change instituted over the past few years at ExxonMobil. We adopted a vision of ""architecture-centric"" software development.

Thus far, the results include a way of thinking about our main product, captured inSALSA; several product-line architectures based onSALSA; a beginning of an architecture-centric reuse effort, also based on SALSA; and a visible change in the way we view and approach software development."
992.0,Excluded,ec3,Delta execution for efficient state-space exploration of object-oriented programs,"State-space exploration is the essence of model checking and an increasingly popular approach for automating test generation. A key issue in exploration of object-oriented programs is handling the program state, in particular the heap. Previous research has focused on standard program execution that operates on one state/heap. We present Delta Execution, a technique that simultaneously operates on several states/heaps. It exploits the fact that many execution paths in state-space exploration partially overlap and speeds up the exploration by sharing the common parts across the executions and separately executing only the ""deltas"" where the executions differ. We have implemented Delta Execution in JPF, a popular general-purpose model checker for Java programs, and in BOX, a specialized model checker that we have developed for efficient exploration of sequential Java programs. We have evaluated Delta Execution for (bounded) exhaustive exploration of ten basic subject programs without errors. The experimental results show that on average Delta Execution improves the exploration time 10.97x (over an order of magnitude) in JPF and 2.07x in BOX. We have also evaluated Delta Execution for one larger case study with errors, where the exploration time improved up to 1.43x."

One key challenge in supporting real-time collaborative programming is semantic conflicts, which may occur when multiple programmers are performing concurrent and incompatible work in interdependent programming segments. Semantic conflicts may result in program errors that are difficult and costly to detect and resolve. In this paper, we present in-depth analyses on representative programming scenarios for understanding the nature and general conditions for semantic conflicts, and propose aDependency-based Automatic Locking (DAL) approach for preventing semantic conflicts. The novelty of the approach is its capabilities of supporting automatic fine-grained locking on interdependent programming segments and providing flexible locking to balance conflict prevention and programmer convenience in real-time collaborative programming environments. The DAL approach has been implemented in the CoEclipse prototype for validating its feasibility."

One of the most relevant is the ability to install and keep up-to-date the measurement tools installed in the production machines in order to collect such data. Even when a few machines are involved, maintaining all the tools required to collect data from the different development tools requires a full-time system administrator. Moreover, since most of these tools are research tools, researchers are updating them very frequently to fix bugs or to add new features.

The service specification describes the global behavior of a system and includes the allocation of the Pr/T-net places to N distributed sites. The paper presents a new algorithm for deriving a protocol specification that defines the behavior of N communicating entities that execute on the N sites and coordinate their actions in order to conform to the global behavior defined by the service specification. Our algorithm decomposes each transition of the service specification into a set of communicating Pr/T-subnets running on the N entities. Moreover, for efficiently controlling the conflict for shared resources, we present a timestamp-based contention control algorithm and incorporate it into the derivation algorithm. A tool has been developed that implements our algorithm and works together with other existing tools for the graphical representation of the service and derived protocol specifications. Two application examples are discussed."

Several tunable amplifiers using various varactor diode topologies as tunable devices are designed by using load-pull techniques and their performances are compared. The amplifier using anti-series distortion-free varactor stack topology achieves 38% power added efficiency and it may be tuned from 1.74 to 2.36 GHz (about 35% tunable range). The amplifier using anti-series/anti-parallel topology is tunable from 1.74 to 2.14 GHz (about 23% tunable range) and provides 42% power added efficiency. It is demonstrated that tunable amplifiers using distortion-free varactor stack topologies provide better power added efficiency than the tunable amplifiers using reverse biased varactor diodes and their linearity is similar to that of a conventional amplifier. These amplifiers may facilitate the realization of frequency agile radio frequency transceiver front-ends and may replace several parallel connected amplifiers used in conventional multimode radios."

Method Fieldwork was carried out in a 2-year training course in agile development. This was validated in two phases (with and without PAL), which were subdivided into two stages: Training and Project. Results The study demonstrates that, on the one hand, the learning process can be facilitated using \{PAL\} to transfer software process knowledge, and on the other hand, products were developed by junior software engineers with a greater degree of independence. Conclusion PAL, as a knowledge repository, helps software engineers to learn about development processes and improves the use of agile processes."

We advocate that the systems built according to this methodology can be effective to convey the flow of knowledge between different communities of practice. Our methodology has been developed from the ground up, i.e. we have built some concrete systems based on the abstract notion of knowledge artifact and synthesized our methodology based on reflections upon our experiences building these systems.

We consider how the deployment of a particular set of design methods enables and constrains not only practical action but also discursive action within the design practice. A case study of agile software development methods illustrates the ways that methods establish conditions for who can speak in the design process and how. We indentify three main kinds of discourse work performed in the invoking of design methods. These are the establishing of ontologies, the authorizing of voices, and the legitimizing of practices. We then discuss implications of this view on methods for CSCW research on the relationship between methods and practice as well as implications for participation in the design process."

Rode, User-centered design of end-user web development tool, Ph.D. Dissertation, Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA, USA, 2005]. Some participants were asked to create a conceptual map to plan their projects and others to write user interaction scenarios; a third group was asked to do whatever they found useful. We describe the planning that each group underwent, how they approached the web development task, and their reactions to the experience afterwards. The overall pattern of results suggests that while the participants who planned using scenarios felt they better understood the web development task, it was the group who created concept maps that explored and incorporated more of the novel programming features of the \{CLICK\} tool. We also discuss the role of gender in the \{CLICK\} development task, noting that women were less likely to explore the tool's novel features and perceived themselves as less successful in the task.

1009.0,Excluded,ec3,Designing and implementing a measurement program for Scrum teams: what do agile developers really need and want?,"Agile developers are generally reluctant to non-agile practices. Promoted by senior software practitioners, agile methods were intended to avoid traditional engineering practices and rather focus on delivering working software as quickly as possible. Thus, the unique measure in Scrum, a well known framework for managing agile projects, is velocity. Its main purpose is to demonstrate the progress in delivering working software. In software engineering (SE), measurement programs have more in depth purposes and allow teams and individuals to improve their development process along with providing better product quality and control over the project. This paper will describe the experience and the approach used in an agile SE company to design and initiate a measurement program taking into account the specificities of their agile environment, principles and values. The lessons learned after five months of investigation are twofold. The first one shows how agile teams, in comparison to traditional teams, have different needs when trying to establish a measurement program. The second confirms that agile teams, as many other groups of workers, are reluctant and resistant to change. Finally, the preliminary results show that agile people are more interested in value delivery, technical debt, and multiple aspects related to team dynamics and will cooperate to the collection of data as soon as there tools can do it for them. It is believed that this research could suggest new guidelines for elaborating specific measurement programs in other agile environments."

1012.0,Excluded,ec3,"Designing evolvable systems in a framework of robust, resilient and sustainable engineering analysis","â€œEvolvabilityâ€� is a concept normally associated with biology or ecology, but recent work on control of interdependent critical infrastructures reveals that network informatics systems can be designed to enable artificial, human systems to â€œevolveâ€�. To explicate this finding, we draw on an analogy between disruptive behavior and stable variation in the history of science and the adaptive patterns of robustness and resilience in engineered systems. We present a definition of an evolvable system in the context of a model of robust, resilient and sustainable systems. Our review of this context and standard definitions indicates that many analysts in engineering (as well as in biology and ecology) do not differentiate Resilience from Robustness. Neither do they differentiate overall dependable system adaptability from a multi-phase process that includes graceful degradation and time-constrained recovery, restabilization, and prevention of catastrophic failure. We analyze how systemic Robustness, Resilience, and Sustainability are related to Evolvability. Our analysis emphasizes the importance of Resilience as an adaptive capability that integrates Sustainability and Robustness to achieve Evolvability. This conceptual framework is used to discuss nine engineering principles that should frame systems thinking about developing evolvable systems. These principles are derived from Kevin Kellyâ€™s book: Out of Control, which describes living and artificial self-sustaining systems. Kellyâ€™s last chapter, â€œThe Nine Laws of God,â€� distills nine principles that govern all life-like systems. We discuss how these principles could be applied to engineering evolvability in artificial systems. This discussion is motivated by a wide range of practical problems in engineered artificial systems. Our goal is to analyze a few examples of system designs across engineering disciplines to explicate a common framework for designing and testing artificial systems. This framework highlights managing increasing complexity, intentional evolution, and resistance to disruptive events. From this perspective, we envision a more imaginative and time-sensitive appreciation of the evolution and operation of â€œreliableâ€� artificial systems. We conclude with a short discussion of two hypothetical examples of engineering evolvable systems in network-centric communications using Error Resilient Data Fusion (ERDF) and cognitive radio."

However, testing software agents is considered a challenging problem. This is due to the special characteristics of agents which include its autonomy, distributed nature, intelligence, and heterogeneous communication protocols. Following the test-driven development (TDD) paradigm, we present a framework that allows \{MAS\} developers to write test scenarios that test each agent individually. The framework relies on the concepts of building mock agents and testing common agent interaction design patterns. We analyze the most common agent interaction patterns including pair and mediation patterns in order to provide stereotype implementation for their corresponding test cases. These implementations serve as test building blocks and are provided as a set of ready-for-reuse components in our repository. This way, the developer can concentrate on testing the business logic itself and spare him/her the burden of implementing tests for the underlying agent interaction patterns. Our framework is based on standard components such as the \{JADE\} agent platform, the \{JUnit\} framework, and the eclipse plug-in architecture. In this paper, we present in details the design and function of the framework. We demonstrate how we can use the proposed framework to define more stereotypes in the code repository and provide a detailed analysis of the code coverage for our designed stereotype test code implementations."
1015.0,Excluded,ec7,Detecting and Classifying Patterns of Requirements Clarifications,"In current project environments, requirements often evolve throughout the project and are worked on by stakeholders in large and distributed teams. Such teams often use online tools such as mailing lists, bug tracking systems or online discussion forums to communicate, clarify or coordinate work on requirements. In this kind of environment, the expected evolution from initial idea, through clarification, to a stable requirement, often stagnates. When project managers are not aware of underlying problems, development may proceed before requirements are fully understood and stabilized, leading to numerous implementation issues and often resulting in the need for early redesign and modification. In this paper, we present an approach to analyzing online requirements communication and a method for the detection and classification of clarification events in requirement discussions. We used our approach to analyze online requirements communication in the IBM® Rational Team Concert® (RTC) project and identified a set of six clarification patterns. Since a predominant amount of clarifications through the lifetime of a requirement is often indicative of problematic requirements, our approach lends support to project managers to assess, in real-time, the state of discussions around a requirement and promptly react to requirements problems."

However, the emphasis has shifted to the ability of the vendors to provide high quality over cost advantage in delivering software products and services. Meeting high quality requirements of the clients is a challenge due to the very nature of development and delivery of software through offshoring. Objective The objective of this research paper is to identify and evaluate the key determinants of quality in the case of software projects delivered through offshoring model. Method A detailed survey was conducted among project managers/project leaders (leads) of a leading midsize Indian \{IT\} services company to evaluate the relationship of the determinants on the attributes of quality. Results Out of six determinants, our research reveals requirements uncertainty has significant association with all the attributes of quality. While process maturity and trained personnel have moderate association, communication and control, knowledge transfer and integration and technical infrastructure have relatively low association on software quality attributes in the case of offshoring. Conclusion It is concluded that the complexities in offshoring necessitates proper capturing of requirements.

This paper describes an undergraduate course in software development recently offered at Lewis & Clark College. The bulk of this course involved the entire group of students working together to develop a computer strategy game. This topic proved enticing to the students and allowed them to experience the development of a significant piece of software. The paper presents the plan for the course as well as evaluation by the instructor, students, and customer."
1019.0,Excluded,ec3,Developing a grounded theory to explain the practices of self-organizing Agile teams,"Software Engineering researchers are constantly looking to improve the quantity and quality of their research findings through the use of an appropriate research methodology. Over the last decade, there has been a sustained increase in the number of researchers exploring the human and social aspects of Software Engineering, many of whom have used Grounded Theory. We have used Grounded Theory as a qualitative research method to study 40 Agile practitioners across 16 software organizations in New Zealand and India and explore how these Agile teams self-organize. We use our study to demonstrate the application of Grounded Theory to Software Engineering. In doing so, we present (a) a detailed description of the Grounded Theory methodology in general and its application in our research in particular; (b) discuss the major challenges we encountered while performing Grounded Theory’s various activities and our strategies for overcoming these challenges; and (c) we present a sample of our data and results to illustrate the artifacts and outcomes of Grounded Theory research."

1022.0,Excluded,ec3,Developing an ISDM Adoption Decision Model Using Delphi and AHP,"Research on information systems development methodologies (ISDM) adoption has been widely undertaken to highlight the experience of developed countries. Studies concerned with the status of ISDM in developing economies including the factors that influence and motivate their use, current trends, difficulties, and barriers to adoption are lacking. This paper explores these issues in a developing economy, namely Oman, and proposes an ISDM adoption decision model using analytical hierarchy process analysis informed by a survey and Delphi consultation. The findings from the survey reveal a lack of knowledge of ISDM amongst Omani Information Systems developers and the reliance on ad-hoc software development methods. Conversely, analyzed data reveals a trend whereby a majority of Omani organizations are gradually moving towards increased ISDM adoption and deployment. This has motivated the development of an adoption decision model to assist software companies to select the right ISDM adapted to their organizational needs in Oman. This model has a generic dimension and can be adapted to other socio-organizational contexts."

Besides advanced knowledge acquisition tools, novel techniques for the quality assurance need to be established in order to maintain a safe development process. In Software Engineering, the application of continuous integration as a collection of practices has proved to be suitable for this task. In this paper, we transfer the general ideas of continuous integration from Software Engineering to Knowledge Engineering, and we demonstrate the implementation of a continuous integration tool into a state-of-the-art Knowledge Engineering workbench."
1024.0,Excluded,ec3,Developing maintainable software: The Readable approach,"Software maintenance is expensive and difficult because software is complex and maintenance requires the understanding of code written by someone else. A prerequisite to maintainability is program understanding, specifically, understanding the control flows between software components. This is especially problematic for emerging software technologies, such as the World Wide Web, because of the lack of formal development practices and because web applications comprise a mix of static and dynamic content. Adequate representations are therefore necessary to facilitate program understanding. This research proposes an approach called Readable (Readable, Executable, Augmentable Database-Linked Environment) that generates executable, tabular representations that can be used to both understand and manipulate software applications. A controlled laboratory experiment carried out to test the efficacy of the approach demonstrates that the representations significantly enhance program understanding. The results suggest that the approach and the corresponding environment may be useful to alleviate problems associated with the software maintainability of new web applications."
1025.0,Excluded,ec7,Developing Production Rule Models to Aid in Acquiring Requirements from Legal Texts,"Regulatory compliance is an important consideration for requirements engineering because recent regulations impose costly penalties for noncompliance. This paper details how developing production rule models can aid in acquiring software requirements from regulatory texts. Production rules enable requirements engineers to gain valuable domain knowledge of a particular legal text by providing the ability to receive precise answers to a specific query. In particular, a production rule model facilitates communication between requirements engineers and legal domain experts, supports and augments requirements elicitation, and resolves ambiguity. Prior work in this area has failed to detail a precise methodology for translating a legal text into production rules, and considered using production rule models for aiding requirements elicitation and validation. This paper introduces our production rule modeling methodology, and demonstrates this methodology using examples from a production rule model for four sections of the U.S. Heath Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)."
1026.0,Included,included,Developing self managing software systems using agile modeling,"Design, development and operation of self managing systems are extremely challenging. Having an appropriate development model is of paramount significance for self managing systems. Various approaches have been studied and used in the past. It has been observed that self managing systems may be very good candidates for agile modelling and development. In this paper, we propose a generic architecture along with a life cycle and an Agile Modelling Approach (AMA) for developing self-managing systems. AMA may be applied to software development projects in an effective, flexible and lightweight manner. Moreover, AMA may be used for requirements, analysis, architecture and design, along with the use-case, object, aspect, data or user-interface models."
1027.0,Excluded,ec3,Developing the software engineering team,"Teamwork is often considered one of the most important ""generic skills"" that we can provide to graduates entering the information technology profession. Often though, through the rush of covering important content, we short change our students by giving them limited opportunities to learn how to work effectively in teams. Students also often complain that although they are expected to work in teams on projects, they are never given any advice or guidance on how to work in a team (Hart and Stone, 2002). Or, if they are given guidance, it is often from a business perspective that students find difficult to integrate into their software development practice.In this paper we discuss a course-spanning initiative to help students learn teamwork skills. This initiative starts in first year by emphasising a core set of skills directly related to working in teams. These skills are applied in small software development teams, with close tutor supervision focusing students on teamwork rather than upon individual software development. The theme then continues into second and third year where the growing sophistication of the students' teamwork skills is complemented by increasing their independence and requiring students to apply a professional software engineering process as a development team. By the end of their course students are then in a position to work together effectively solving complex problems for a real industry client."
1028.0,Excluded,ec3,Development of a dynamic data interchange scheme to support product design in agile manufacturing,"A proficient information system features the capability to response to customer changes in a timely manner such that it facilitates enterprise to achieve the concept of agile manufacturing. The efficient sharing of data and knowledge within an organization is the prerequisite to enhance the competitiveness of companies in this information age. In today's industrial environment, there are a great variety of computer systems and applications, which make the task of data integration among heterogeneous database systems even more difficult and costly, thus hindering the progress of tasks automation. In general, there is a lack of research literature related to the generic approach to link dissimilar databases together for seamless data communication. Therefore, a comprehensive mechanism is required to handle various data format in complex product design processes in order to achieve efficient knowledge retrieval and update information manipulation. This paper introduces a dynamic data interchange scheme which attempts to exchange the data automatically as well as enables the filtering of valuable data between traditional relational database model and case-based reasoning knowledge repository. The significance of this paper is concerned with the intelligent data exchange within a hybrid database system, embracing the empirical data to help agile manufacturing enterprises make critical decisions."

1030.0,Excluded,ec3,Development of a team measure for tacit knowledge in software development teams,"In this paper we operationally define and measure tacit knowledge at the team-level in the software development domain. Through a series of three empirical studies we developed and validated the team tacit knowledge measure (TTKM) for software developers. In the first study, initial scale items were developed using the repertory grid technique and content analysis. In Study 2, supplied repertory grids were administered to novices and experts to establish differential items, and Study 3 validated the \{TTKM\} on a sample of 48 industrial software development teams. In developing the \{TTKM\} we explored the relationships between tacit knowledge, explicit job knowledge and social interaction and their effect on team performance as measured by efficiency and effectiveness. In addition we assess the implications for managing software development teams and increasing team performance through social interaction."
1031.0,Excluded,ec3,Development of an intelligent agent-based AGV controller for a flexible manufacturing system,"Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are the most flexible means to transport materials among workstations of a flexible manufacturing system. Complex issues associated with the design of AGV control of these systems are conflict-free shortest path, minimum time motion planning and deadlock avoidance. This research presents an intelligent agent-based framework to overcome the inefficacies associated with the aforementioned issues. Proposed approach describes the operational control of AGVs by integrating different activities such as path generation, journey time enumeration, collision and deadlock identification, waiting node location and its time estimation, and decision making on the selection of the conflict-free shortest feasible path. It represents efficient algorithms and rules associated with each agent for finding the conflict-free minimum time motion planning of AGVs, which are needed to navigate unidirectional and bidirectional flow path network. A collaborative architecture of AGV agent and its different modules are also presented. Three complex experimental scenarios are simulated to test the robustness of the proposed approach. It is shown that the proposed agent-based controller is capable of generating optimal, collision- and deadlock-free path with less computational efforts."
1032.0,Excluded,ec3,Development of auxiliary functions: should you be agile? an empirical assessment of pair programming and test-first programming,"A considerable part of software systems is comprised of functions that support the main modules, such as array or string manipulation and basic math computation. These auxiliary functions are usually considered less complex, and thus tend to receive less attention from developers. However, failures in these functions might propagate to more critical modules, thereby affecting the system's overall reliability. Given the complementary role of auxiliary functions, a question that arises is whether agile practices, such as pair programming and test-first programming, can improve their correctness without affecting time-to-market. This paper presents an empirical assessment comparing the application of these agile practices with more traditional approaches. Our study comprises independent experiments of pair versus solo programming, and test-first versus test-last programming. The first study involved 85 novice programmers who applied both traditional and agile approaches in the development of six auxiliary functions within three different domains. Our results suggest that the agile practices might bring benefits in this context. In particular, pair programmers delivered correct implementations much more often, and test-first programming encouraged the production of larger and higher coverage test sets. On the downside, the main experiment showed that both practices significantly increase total development time. A replication of the test-first experiment with professional developers shows similar results."

We explain underlying ideas, illustrate the functionality of DialogDesigner and discuss its strengths."
1035.0,Excluded,ec3,Dialogues and the problems of knowing: Reinventing the architectural competition,"Summary We describe and analyze the introduction of legitimate dialogues in architectural competitions. What happens to the competition when the contestants are allowed to interact with each other and with the competition jury? We consider dialogues to be a supplementary social technology that is becoming embedded in well-known forms of architectural competitions. By enabling feedback on preliminary design ideas and solutions, the dialogues are meant to accelerate processes of clarification and learning, and to enable the contestants to implement changes and improvements during the development of their final design entries. However, in an empirical study the actual effects proved less straight-forward. The feedback allowed the architects to react and adapt, but in some cases they reacted and adapted in ways which they later regretted. By showing that feedback may also mislead the architectural teams to draw wrong implications we are sensitized to the inherent problems in knowing certain things ahead of time. We elaborate on this dilemma and suggest some implications for the theory and management of architectural competitions."
1036.0,Excluded,ec3,Digital representation of park use and visual analysis of visitor activities,"Urban public parks can serve an important function by contributing to urban citizensâ€™ quality of life. At the same time, they can be the location of processes of displacement and exclusion. Despite this ambiguous role, little is known about actual park use patterns. To learn more about park use in three parks in Zurich, Switzerland, extensive data on visitor activities was collected using a new method based on direct recording via a portable \{GIS\} solution. Then, the data was analyzed using qualitative and quantitative methods. This paper examines whether geographic visualization of these data can help domain experts like landscape designers and park managers to assess park use. To maximize accessibility, the visualizations are made available through a web-interface of a common, off-the-shelf GIS. The technical limitations imposed by this choice are critically assessed, before the available visualization techniques are evaluated in respect to the needs and tasks of practitioners with limited knowledge on spatial analysis and GIS. Key criteria are each techniqueâ€™s level of abstraction and graphical complexity. The utility and suitability of the visualization techniques is characterized for the distinct phases of exploration, analysis and synthesis. The findings suggest that for a target user group of practitioners, a combination of dot maps showing the raw data and surface maps showing derived density values for several attributes serves the purpose of knowledge generation best."

This paper describes the vision, implementation and initial evaluation of CoffeeTable - a fully featured research prototype resulting from our reflections on the software design process. CoffeeTable exchanges the traditional IDE for one built around a shared interactive desk. The proposed solution encourages smooth transitions between agile and traditional modes of working whilst helping to create a shared vision and common reference frame - key to sustaining a good design. This paper also presents early results from the evaluation of CoffeeTable and offers some insights from the lessons learned.

1038.0,Excluded,ec3,Dimensions of software engineering course design,"A vast variety of topics relate to the field of Software Engineering. Some universities implement curricula covering all aspects of Software Engineering. A number of other courses cover detailed aspects, e.g. programming, usability and security issues, analysis, architecture, design, and quality. Other universities offer general curricula considering Software Engineering in few or single course only. In each case, a course set has to be defined which directly relates to a specific student outcome. This work provides a method for categorizing and analyzing a course set within abstract dimensions for course design. We subsequently show the results of applying the dimensions to the course degree scheme in use. The course design dimensions can also be related to the student outcomes defined in SE2004 CC Section 3.2 [10]."

However, while defending against such abuse is generally considered a technical endeavor, we argue that there is an increasing role played by human labor markets. Using over seven years of data from the popular crowd-sourcing site Freelancer.com, as well data from our own active job solicitations, we characterize the labor market involved in service abuse. We identify the largest classes of abuse work, including account creation, social networking link generation and search engine optimization support, and characterize how pricing and demand have evolved in supporting this activity."

Naturally, the team composition and teamwork affect the project results.The aim of this paper is to find a connection between successful projects and team properties. Early recognition would be useful when the teacher or team instructor tries to help the teams to overcome possible obstacles caused by personal or team weaknesses. We gathered a vast amount of data on 40 students during selected capstone projects with questionnaires, interviews and expert observation over five semesters. The paper shows our measurement technique and its ability to reflect success in the capstone projects.Close examination of the data revealed that certain team properties and operations were more significant in relation to expert evaluation than other. These factors are called high-impact factors for successful projects. Most significant were pre-learned skills in Computer Science curriculum, communication, coordination, and teamwork. Some success signs were evident from the beginning of the projects, including attitudes and personal needs."
1044.0,Excluded,ec3,Discovering the software process by means of stochastic workflow analysis,"A fundamental feature of the software process consists in its own stochastic nature. A convenient approach for extracting the stochastic dynamics of a process from log data is that of modelling the process as a Markov model: in this way the discovery of the short/medium range dynamics of the process is cast in terms of the learning of Markov models of different orders, i.e. in terms of learning the corresponding transition matrices. In this paper we show that the use of a full Bayesian approach in the learning process helps providing robustness against statistical noise and over-fitting, as the size of a transition matrix grows exponentially with the order of the model. We give a specific modelâ€“model similarity definition and the corresponding calculation procedure to be used in model-to-sequence or sequence-to-sequence conformance assessment, this similarity definition could also be applied to other inferential tasks, such as unsupervised process learning."

The purpose of the study was to create a participatory design process to investigate factors that affect the acceptance of mobile \{ICT\} in a surgical ward. Methods Observations, interviews, a participatory design process, and pilot testing of a prototype of a co-constructed application were used. Results Informal rhythms existed at the department that facilitated that people met and interacted several times throughout the day. These gatherings allowed for opportunistic encounters that were extensively used for dialogue, problem solving, coordination, message and logistics handling. A prototype based on handheld mobile computers was introduced. The tool supported information seeking functionality that previously required local mobility. By making the nurses more freely mobile, the tool disrupted these informal rhythms. This created dissatisfaction with the system, and lead to discussion and introduction of other arenas to solve coordination and other problems. Conclusions Mobile \{ICT\} tools may break down informal communication and coordination structures. This may reduce the efficiency of the new tools, or contribute to resistance towards such systems. In some situations however such â€œdisrupted rhythmsâ€� may be overcome by including additional sociotechnical mechanisms in the overall design to counteract this negative side-effect."

At the same time, globally distributed software development is another trend delivering high-quality software to global users at lower costs. Little is published about the adoption and adaption of Agile methods in a distributed team and software globalization/localization project environment. The overall performance and satisfaction with the international deployment of the latest version of My Yahoo! increased by more than 30% after the global product team, distributed over three continents, adopted Agile methods.

1049.0,Excluded,ec3,Distributed development considered harmful?,"We offer a case study illustrating three rules for reporting research to industrial practitioners. Firstly, report relevant results; e.g. this paper explores the effects of dis- tributed development on software products. Second: recheck old results if new results call them into question. Many papers say distributed development can be harmful to software quality. Previous work by Bird et al. allayed that concern but a recent paper by Posnett et al. suggests that the Bird result was biased by the kinds of files it explored. Hence, this paper rechecks that result and finds significant differences in Microsoft products (Office 2010) between software built by distributed or collocated teams. At first glance, this recheck calls into question the widespread practice of distributed development. Our third rule is to reflect on results to avoid confusing practitioners with an arcane mathematical analysis. For example, on reflection, we found that the effect size of the differences seen in the collocated and distributed software was so small that it need not concern industrial practitioners. Our conclusion is that at least for Microsoft products, dis- tributed development is not considered harmful."

Interviews indicated that the major areas of learning were informal skills that included learning to establish and work effectively within a team, learning how to react quickly to frequent changes in requirements, architecture and organization, and learning to manage and optimize communications. Since all these skills require rapid reaction to unpredictable factors, we view them as improvisation and discuss the role of experiential education in facilitating improvisation."

1053.0,Excluded,ec7,Distributing Refinements of a System-Level Partial Behavior Model,"Early in a system's life cycle, a system's behavior is typically partially specified using scenarios, invariants, and temporal properties. These specifications prohibit or require certain behaviors, while leaving other behaviors uncategorized into either of those. Engineers refine the specification by eliciting more requirements to finally arrive at a complete behavioral description. Partial-behavior models have been utilized as a formal foundation for capturing partial system specifications. Mapping the requirements to partial behavior models enables automated analyses (e.g., requirements consistency checking) and helps to elicit new requirements. Under the current practices, software systems are reasoned about and their behavior specified exclusively at the system level, disregarding of the fact that a system typically consists of interacting components. However, exclusively refining a behavior specification at the system-level runs the risk of arriving at an inconsistent specification, i.e. one that is not realizable as a composition of the system's components. To address this problem, we propose a framework that provides the lacking support: a newly specified requirement implicitly refines the system's underlying partial behavior model; our framework maps the new requirement to components by automatically distributing the system model refinements to the components' underlying models. By doing so, our framework prevents requirements inconsistencies and helps to identify further necessary requirements. We discuss the framework's soundness and correctness, and demonstrate its features on a case study previously used in related literature."

It is contended that such published work is of minimal value to the practitioner and does not add anything to the guidance available before the existence of current agile methods. A survey of agile GSD related publications, from XP/Agile conferences between 2001 and 2005, is used to support this claim.

1056.0,Excluded,ec3,Do secure information system design methods provide adequate modeling support?,"Information system development (ISD) methods lack security features. To address this problem, various secure information system (SIS) design methods have been proposed. An important feature of these methods is modeling support, which manifests itself through modeling notations. This paper explores the extent to which the alternative \{SIS\} design methods offer modeling support. The results suggest that extant \{SIS\} design methods provide only limited modeling support. No single \{SIS\} design method offers comprehensive modeling support. This result has implications for practice and research. Practitioners may need to combine different \{SIS\} design methods for the development of secure information systems (IS). In turn, scholars and \{SIS\} design method developers should ensure that future \{SIS\} design methods offer comprehensive modeling support. Finally, empirical studies should be conducted to explore the usability of the current conceptual models of secure systems design methods in practice."

1059.0,Included,included,Documentation Work in Agile Teams: The Role of Documentation Formalism in Achieving a Sustainable Practice.,"As its second guiding principle, agile software development promotes working software over comprehensive documentation. In this paper we investigate alignment between two different documentation practices and agile development. We report upon an experiment conducted to explore the impact of formalism and media type on various dimensions of documentation practice in agile teams. 28 students in 8 teams were divided into two groups: SAD and UML. Group SAD was to update and deliver their high-level software architecture in form of a textual description defined by RUP templates. Group UML was instructed to update and deliver their low-level software design in form of UML models. Our results show that iterative documentation practices led to more extensive and more detailed textual documentation. We found that writing documentation was perceived as a intrusive task leading to task specialization and allocation of documentation to less qualified team members. Consequently, this hampered collaboration within the team. Based in our findings, we suggest that if documentation is to be delivered with the project, producing documentation should be communicated and accepted by the team as a proper product. Furthermore, we argue that codification of internal development knowledge should be a non-intrusive task."

Even though several studies were already conducted, which concerned design decision rationale documentation approaches, a few of them focused on performances and evaluated them in laboratory. This paper proposes a technique to document design decision rationale, and evaluates experimentally the impact such a technique has on effectiveness and efficiency of individual/team decision-making in presence of requirement changes. The study was conducted as a controlled experiment. Fifty post-graduate Master students performed in the role of experiment subjects. Documented design decisions regarding the Ambient Intelligence paradigm constituted the experiment objects. Main results of the experiment show that, for both individual and team-based decision-making, effectiveness significantly improves, while efficiency remains unaltered, when decision-makers are allowed to use, rather not use, the proposed design rationale documentation technique."

Insights from the software development community,"The Unified Modeling Language (UML) has become the de facto standard for systems development and has been promoted as a technology that will help solve some of the longstanding problems in the software industry. However, there is still little empirical evidence supporting the claim that \{UML\} is an effective approach to modeling software systems. Indeed, there is much anecdotal evidence suggesting the contrary, i.e. that \{UML\} is overly complex, inconsistent, incomplete and difficult to learn. This paper describes an investigation into the adoption and use of \{UML\} in the software development community. A web-based survey was conducted eliciting responses from users of \{UML\} worldwide. Results indicate a wide diversity of opinion regarding UML, reflecting the relative immaturity of the technology as well as the controversy over its effectiveness. This paper discusses the results of the survey and charts of the course for future research in \{UML\} usage."

A comparative multiple-case study,"Software architecture design is challenging, especially for junior software designers. Lacking practice and experience, junior designers need process support in order to make rational architecture decisions. In this paper, we present the results of a comparative multiple-case study conducted to find out if decision viewpoints from van Heesch et al. (2012, in press) can provide such a support. The case study was conducted with four teams of software engineering students working in industrial software projects. Two of the four teams were instructed to document their decisions using decision viewpoints; the other two teams were not instructed to do so. We observed the students for a period of seven weeks by conducting weekly focus groups and by analyzing their work artifacts and minutes. Our findings suggest that junior designers who use decision viewpoints are more systematic in exploring and evaluating solution options. However, the decision viewpoints did not help them in managing requirements and complexity."

A meta-analysis of empirical evidence,"The question whether risk management contributes to \{IT\} project success is considered relevant by people from both academic and practitionersâ€™ communities already for a long time. This paper presents a meta-analysis of the empirical evidence that either supports or opposes the claim that risk management contributes to \{IT\} project success. In addition, this paper also investigates the validity of the assumptions on which risk management is based. The analysis leads to remarkable conclusions. Over the last 10 years, much has become known about what causes \{IT\} projects to fail. However, there is still very little empirical evidence that this knowledge is actually used in projects for managing risks in \{IT\} projects. This paper concludes with indicating new directions for research in the relation between risk management and project success. Key elements are stakeholder perception of risk and success and stakeholder behaviour in the risk management process."

It is well known that software maintainability is one of the most important concerns and cost factors of the software industry. The question of this research is whether Extreme Programming intrinsically delivers easily maintainable code or not. We propose a model on how to evaluate the evolution of source code quality and in particular maintainability in an Extreme Programming environment and evaluate it with a small case study. The results obtained from the case study seem to sustain the hypothesis that Extreme Programming enhances quality and in particular maintainability of a software product. Given such promising results, additional experimentation is required to validate and generalize the results of this work."

Safety critical domains, such as transportation, exhibit interesting features, such as high levels of non-determinism, complex interactions, stringent safety properties, multifaceted timing attributes, etc. The formal representation of these features is a challenging task. This paper presents our experience of modeling land transportation domain in the formal framework of Event-B. We explore the possibility of using Event-B as a domain engineering tool.

Determining and negotiating the scope in a product line that spans several business units with their own economic goals is challenging. Feature modeling offers a good way to do variability/commonality analysis for complex product lines. A precondition for feature modeling is the identification of all features supporting the product line. To identify these features, we developed a method for systematically deriving a feature model top down based on domain know-how. We call this method domain specific feature modeling. As the primary artifact to describe the problem space, a domain specific feature model additionally improves the requirement understanding for all stakeholders by considerably improving the scoping, traceability, testing, efficiency and transparency of planning activities and making the development efforts easier to estimate. In this paper, we share our experience with domain specific feature modeling in a large platform project and describe the lessons learned. We describe our general approach that can also be used for other domains."

We examine the relationship between different ownership measures and software failures in two large software projects: Windows Vista and Windows 7. We find that in all cases, measures of ownership such as the number of low-expertise developers, and the proportion of ownership for the top owner have a relationship with both pre-release faults and post-release failures. We also empirically identify reasons that low-expertise developers make changes to components and show that the removal of low-expertise contributions dramatically decreases the performance of contribution based defect prediction. Finally we provide recommendations for source code change policies and utilization of resources such as code inspections based on our results."

It is shown how built-in .NET features such as reflection, interception, and custom meta-data facilitate the QoS integration. Throughout the paper we compare the design and implementation of DotQoS to a CORBA-based QoS framework that we developed in a previous project.

1071.0,Excluded,ec3,Drivers of agile software development use: Dialectic interplay between benefits and hindrances,"Context Agile software development with its emphasis on producing working code through frequent releases, extensive client interactions and iterative development has emerged as an alternative to traditional plan-based software development methods. While a number of case studies have provided insights into the use and consequences of agile, few empirical studies have examined the factors that drive the adoption and use of agile. Objective We draw on intention-based theories and a dialectic perspective to identify factors driving the use of agile practices among adopters of this software development methodology. Method Data for the study was gathered through an anonymous online survey of software development professionals. We requested participation from members of a selected list of online discussion groups, and received 98 responses. Results Our analyses reveal that subjective norm and training play a significant role in influencing software developersâ€™ use of agile processes and methods, while perceived benefits and perceived limitations are not primary drivers of agile use among adopters. Interestingly, perceived benefit emerges as a significant predictor of agile use only if adopters face hindrances to their agile practices. Conclusion We conclude that research in the adoption of software development innovations should examine the effects of both enabling and detracting factors and the interactions between them. Since training, subjective norm, and the interplay between perceived benefits and perceived hindrances appear to be key factors influencing the adoption of agile methods, researchers can focus on how to (a) perform training on agile methods more effectively, (b) facilitate the dialog between developers and managers about perceived benefits and hindrances, and (c) capitalize on subjective norm to publicize the benefits of agile methods within an organization. Further, when managing the transition to new software development methods, we recommend that practitioners adapt their strategies and tactics contingent on the extent of perceived hindrances to the change."

This shift in perspective has gone relatively unnoticed by current software engineering research. This paper offers a glimpse at what processes and instruments lie beyond “current” software engineering research, where studying emergent DyNOs, their creation and steering becomes critical. To understand the underpinnings of this evolution, we explored a simple yet vivid scenario from real-life industrial practice. Using scenario analysis we elicited a number of social and organizational requirements in working with DyNOs. Also, comparing our evidence with literature, we made some key observations. First, managing DyNOs makes organizational requirements a first-class entity for development success. Second, research in software engineering should be invested in understanding and governing the DyNOs behind the software lifecycle."
1079.0,Excluded,ec3,Dynamic provisioning in multi-tenant service clouds,"Cloud-based systems promise an on-demand service provisioning system along with a “pay-as-you-use” policy. In the case of multi-tenant systems this would mean dynamic creation of a tenant by integrating existing cloud-based services on the fly. Presently, dynamic creation of a tenant is handled by building the required components from scratch. Although multi-tenant systems help providers save cost by allocating multiple tenants to the same instance of an application, they incur huge reconfiguration costs. Cost and time spent on these reconfiguration activities can be reduced by re-constructing tenants from existing tenant configurations supported by service providers. Multi-tenant cloud-based systems also lack the facility of allowing clients to specify their requirements. Giving clients the flexibility to specify requirements helps them avoid spending an excessive amount of time and effort looking through a list of services, many of which might not be relevant to them. Moreover, dynamic provisioning in the cloud requires an integrated solution across the technology stack (software, platform and infrastructure) combining functional, non-functional and resource allocation requirements. Existing research works in the area of web service matching, although numerous, still fall short, since they usually consider each requirement type in isolation and cannot provide an integrated solution. To that end, in this paper we investigate the features needed for dynamic service provisioning on the cloud. We propose a novel User Interface-Tenant Selector-Customizer (UTC) model and approach, which enables cloud-based services to be systematically modeled and provisioned as variants of existing service tenants in the cloud. Our approach considers functional, non-functional and resource allocation requirements, which are explicitly specified by the client via the user interface component of the model. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first such integrated approach. We illustrate our ideas using a realistic running example, and also present a proof-of-concept prototype built using IBM’s Rational Software Architect modeling tool. We also present experimental results demonstrating the applicability of our matching algorithm. Our results show significant reduction in matching time with the help of an elimination process that reduces the search space needed for performing matching."

These \{VOs\} span across organisational boundaries and enable the enactment of collaborative processes that integrate services, resources and knowledge in order to perform tasks that the \{VO\} partners could not undertake on their own. Such a dynamic and complex structure opens several challenging problems relating to \{VO\} security. In this paper, we summarise a novel architecture supporting Grid-enabled collaboration for the purposes of Application Service Provision. We then focus on the underpinning security architecture that enables the federated management and distributed enforcement of dynamic security perimeters for virtual communities of services, and on resources that span across administrative and enterprise boundaries. We highlight how this architecture, realised in the context of a European research project developing a Grid platform for application serviced provision, addresses the outstanding challenges that underlie the automation of trust and security management in scalable, multi-institutional, and dynamic Virtual Organisations."

Hence, it becomes critical to ensure that code generator development doesn't become a bottleneck for the project delivery. After establishing a sophisticated technology infrastructure to facilitate quick and easy adaptation of model-based code generators, we experimented with agile methodology. In this paper, we discuss why pure agile methodology does not work for model-driven software development.

The type of information yielded by each method is also described. The results show the techniques give a consistent priority.

They cause internal conflicts that can not only cost a software team time and money, but may also detract from the needs of the productpsilas end users. In this paper, we explore the use of concept maps as a means of mitigating such team conflicts. Approaching agile usability through the lens of distributed cognition, concept mapping could improve team communications. We conducted interviews with eleven practitioners from three local software development companies to gain preliminary evidence of the practicality of the approach. Participants were questioned about their challenges in agile development and about their overall impressions of a concept mapping approach. We asked about the practicality and acceptability of implementing such a methodology, along with general concerns and recommendations. Results indicate that there is a need for improvement in agile usability, and a concept mapping approach is promising for addressing existing concerns. With refinement of the method and the development of the proper tools, this approach has great potential to improve team interaction in agile usability environments."
1086.0,Excluded,ec7,Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax (EARS),"The development of complex systems frequently in-valves extensive work to elicit, document and review stakeholder requirements. Stakeholder requirements are usually written in unconstrained natural language, which is inherently imprecise. During system development, problems in stakeholder requirements inevitably propagate to lower levels. This creates unnecessary volatility and risk, which impact programme schedule and cost. Some experts advocate the use of other notations to in-crease precision and minimise problems such as ambiguity. However, use of non-textual notations requires translation of the source requirements, which can introduce further errors. There is also a training overhead associated with the introduction of new notations. A small set of structural rules was developed to address eight common requirement problems including ambiguity, complexity and vagueness. The ruleset allows all natural language requirements to be expressed in one of five simple templates. The ruleset was applied whilst extracting aero engine control system requirements from an airworthiness regulation document. The results of this case study show qualitative and quantitative improvements compared with a conventional textual requirements specification."

Many factors contribute to the success or failure of an offshore Agile software development, e.g. development strategy, project type, communication channel, cultural differences, split locations and size of a project. This research focuses on the effect of first two on the offshore software development. In this paper, we also report on success rate and suitability of different types of software projects and development strategies using offshore Agile software development. Our survey indicates that coding and testing phases are best suited for off shoring in any iteration of discipline-oriented sprint life cycle development.

State of the art technology that was employed to facilitate projects a few years ago are typically obsolete today. Presently, there are requirements for higher quality software with less tolerance for errors, produced in compressed timelines with fewer people. Therefore, project success is more elusive than ever and is contingent upon many key aspects. One of the most crucial aspects is social factors. These social factors, such as knowledge sharing. motivation, and customer collaboration, can be addressed through agile practices. This paper will demonstrate two successful industrial software projects which are different in all aspects; however, both still apply agile practices to address social factors.

Forty pairs of engineering students completed several program understanding tasks while their gaze was synchronously recorded. The coupling of the programmers' focus of attention was measured by a cross-recurrence analysis of gaze that captures how much programmers look at the same sequence of spots within a short time span. A high level of gaze cross-recurrence is typical for pairs who actively engage in grounding efforts to build and maintain shared understanding. As part of their grounding efforts, programmers may use text selection to perform collaborative references. Broadcast selections serve as indexing sites for the selector as they attract non-selector's gaze shortly after they become visible. Gaze cross-recurrence is highest when selectors accompany their selections with speech to produce a multimodal reference."

Moreover, very often not only a single product, but a whole product line with different compositions of components and functions must be developed. To cope with this complexity, it is important that engineers have intuitive, but precise means for specifying the requirements for these systems and have tools for automatically finding inconsistencies within the requirements, because these could lead to costly iterations in the later development. We propose a technique for the scenario-based specification of component interactions based on Modal Sequence Diagrams. Moreover, we developed an efficient technique for automatically finding inconsistencies in the scenario-based specification of many variants at once by exploiting recent advances in the model-checking of product lines. Our evaluation shows benefits of this technique over performing individual consistency checking of each variant specification."

1101.0,Excluded,ec3,Efficient support of dynamic inheritance for class- and prototype-based languages,"Dynamically typed languages are becoming increasingly popular for different software development scenarios where runtime adaptability is important. Therefore, existing class-based platforms such as Java and .Net have been gradually incorporating dynamic features to support the execution of these languages. The implementations of dynamic languages on these platforms commonly generate an extra layer of software over the virtual machine, which reproduces the reflective prototype-based object model provided by most dynamic languages. Simulating this model frequently involves a runtime performance penalty, and makes the interoperation between class- and prototype-based languages difficult. Instead of simulating the reflective model of dynamic languages, our approach has been to extend the object-model of an efficient class-based virtual machine with prototype-based semantics, so that it can directly support both kinds of languages. Consequently, we obtain the runtime performance improvement of using the virtual machine \{JIT\} compiler, while a direct interoperation between languages compiled to our platform is also possible. In this paper, we formalize dynamic inheritance for both class- and prototype-based languages, and implement it as an extension of an efficient virtual machine that performs \{JIT\} compilation. We also present an extensive evaluation of the runtime performance and memory consumption of the programming language implementations that provide dynamic inheritance, including ours."

The original method was adapted to incremental development and evaluated on a large industrial system with modification of software from the previous release. We modified the following elements of the original method: a) complexity assessment of actors and use cases, and b) the handling of non-functional requirements and team factors that may affect effort. For incremental development, we added two elements to the method: c) counting both all and the modified actors and transactions of use cases, and d) effort estimation for secondary changes of software not reflected in use cases. We finally extended the method to: e) cover all development effort in a very large project. The method was calibrated using data from one release and it produced an estimate for the successive release that was only 17% lower than the actual effort. The study identified factors affecting effort on large projects with incremental development. It also showed how these factors can be calibrated for a specific context and produce relatively accurate estimates."

Software organizations usually have defined processes, but they usually lack information about how processes are actually executed. Moreover, there is no explicit information about process instances and activities. Existing process mining techniques face problems in coping with such environment. We propose a tool, Egidio, which uses non-invasively collected data and builds organizational models. In particular, we explain the tool within a software company, which is able to extract different aspects of development processes. The main contribution of Egidio is the ability to mine processes and organizational models from fine-grained data collected in a non-invasive manner, without interrupting the developers’ work."

In the study, we captured the practices the teams felt contributed to rapid delivery. We identified a mix of Agile and architecture practices that teams apply to rapidly field software and minimize disruption and delay. In this paper, we elaborate one practice from the study, prototyping with quality attribute focus. We compared two experiences in prototyping focused on quality attribute considerations applied on Scrum projects. We observe through interviews that feature development and prototyping practice spans multiple levels: feature development/sprint, release planning, and portfolio planning. We also observe other factors including rapid trade-off analysis, flexible architecture, and adoption of a set of enabling prototyping guidelines. The analysis of the observations sheds light on several aspects of the practice that enable the team to respond quickly and efficiently when prototype feedback suggests architectural change.

In this paper, we take a step beyond from the design of the technical artifact that allows collaborative coding, and consider the consequences of such an approach to software development in a more general sense, in particular from the perspective of version management. The goal is to integrate collaborative development with traditional facilities commonly associated with software engineering.

This paper discusses the needs and the possibilities that exist for leveraging these technologies and sensors with \{RFID\} to guarantee continuous and seamless visibility of all assets (fixed and mobile resources and field personnel) of smart enterprises, thereby expanding and complementing the roles of RFID. It examines the design challenges for the integration of these technologies for advanced logistics operations at the level of product classes or their instances. It then outlines our development of an embedded microsystem that combines RFID, GPRS, \{GPS\} and environmental sensors for applications in logistics. The prototyped microsystem demonstrated the feasibility of the multi-sensor integration paradigm that the paper proposes."

These properties strongly impact on how service-oriented systems are engineered, built, and operated, as well as verified.

Competencies are improved or gained by executing qualifying tasks. A knowledge market paradigm is introduced to improve the fit between supply and demand of knowledge required by actors performing such qualifying tasks. The eventual work performed by actors can be atomically divided into execution tasks. Discrepancies may exist in the suitability match of actors and the execution tasks that have been allocated to them. Therefore, a knowledge workers market paradigm is introduced as a possible solution to improve the fit between actors and execution tasks."

1116.0,Excluded,ec3,Empirical evaluation of distributed pair programming,"Pair programming, in which two individuals share a single computer to collaboratively develop software, has been shown to have many benefits in industry and in education. One drawback of pair programming is its collocation requirement, which limits its use to situations where the partners can physically meet. A tool that supported distributed pair programming, in which the partners could pair from separate locations, would remove this impediment. This paper discusses the development and empirical evaluation of such a tool. A significant feature of this tool is the presence of a second cursor that supports gesturing. Students who used the tool in their introductory programming course performed as well as collocated students on their programming assignments and final exam. These students also spent less time working by themselves. They also felt that the gesturing feature was useful and used it regularly."

PRA is characterized by two forms: an assessment at the end of each production iteration, followed by a summative assessment after production has ended. An empirical evaluation of PRA was conducted within a fifteen-week immersive studio--a student-driven, faculty-mentored learning experience in which all learner activity is directed toward a single project, undertaken in collaboration with a community partner. This evaluation reveals that students maintain primary focus on pragmatic production issues during the studio duration, although with secondary yet consistent focus on learning and development. PRA surfaces how the immersive studio produced positive learning outcomes with respect to interdisciplinary collaboration and lifetime learning."

This paper proposes an \{SPI\} implementation strategy that has been developed in lines with standard \{SPI\} models and frameworks, intended to be suitable for global software development (GSD), and exploiting ideas of incremental deliveries, short iterations with frequent reviews and close collaboration with customers. Quantitative analyses of data from case studies within large \{GSD\} show that improvement teams implementing the strategy are more likely to have better progress and achieve better effectiveness in terms of improvement deployment within development teams. The results could be useful to \{SPI\} practitioners in making their \{SPI\} initiatives more successful."
1119.0,Excluded,ec3,Empirical evidence in global software engineering: a systematic review,"Recognized as one of the trends of the 21st century, globalization of the world economies brought significant changes to nearly all industries, and in particular it includes software development. Many companies started global software engineering (GSE) to benefit from cheaper, faster and better development of software systems, products and services. However, empirical studies indicate that achieving these benefits is not an easy task. Here, we report our findings from investigating empirical evidence in GSE-related research literature. By conducting a systematic review we observe that the GSE field is still immature. The amount of empirical studies is relatively small. The majority of the studies represent problem-oriented reports focusing on different aspects of GSE management rather than in-depth analysis of solutions for example in terms of useful practices or techniques. Companies are still driven by cost reduction strategies, and at the same time, the most frequently discussed recommendations indicate a necessity of investments in travelling and socialization. Thus, at the same time as development goes global there is an ambition to minimize geographical, temporal and cultural separation. These are normally integral parts of cross-border collaboration. In summary, the systematic review results in several descriptive classifications of the papers on empirical studies in GSE and also reports on some best practices identified from literature."

This paper describes a controlled experiment that investigated the distinctions between the effectiveness of Test First and that of Test Last (TL) (the traditional approach). The experimental results showed that Test First teams spent a larger percentage of time on testing. The achievable minimum external quality of delivered software applications increased with the percentage of time spent on testing regardless of the testing strategy (TF or TL) applied, although there does not exist a linear correlation between them. With four yearsâ€™ data, it is also found that a strong linear correlation between the amount of effort spent on testing and coding in Test First teams, while this phenomenon was not observed in Test Last teams."

The studies were grouped into four themes: introduction and adoption, human and social factors, perceptions on agile methods, and comparative studies. The review investigates what is currently known about the benefits and limitations of, and the strength of evidence for, agile methods. Implications for research and practice are presented. The main implication for research is a need for more and better empirical studies of agile software development within a common research agenda.

The speed offered by agile practices is needed to hit the market, while reuse is needed for long-term productivity, efficiency, and profit. The paper presents an empirical investigation of factors influencing speed and reuse in three large product developing organizations seeking to implement Agile practices. The paper identifies, through a multiple case study with 3 organizations, 114 business-, process-, organizational-, architecture-, knowledge- and communication factors with positive or negative influences on reuse, speed or both. Contributions are a categorized inventory of influencing factors, a display for organizing factors for the purpose of process improvement work, and a list of key improvement areas to address when implementing reuse in organizations striving to become more Agile. Categories identified include good factors with positive influences on reuse or speed, harmful factors with negative influences, and complex factors involving inverse or ambiguous relationships. Key improvement areas in the studied organizations are intra-organizational communication practices, reuse awareness and practices, architectural integration and variability management. Results are intended to support process improvement work in the direction of Agile product development. Feedback on results from the studied organizations has been that the inventory captures current situations, and is useful for software process improvement work."
1127.0,Excluded,ec7,Enablers and Inhibitors of Expediting Systems Engineering,"Rapid fielding or expedited systems development plays a major role in developing systems to provide a quick response to the organization. Instead of polishing and perfecting all requirements with possible delivery delays, these urgent needs programs must adapt themselves to have a life cycle that is driven by a â€œFaster, Faster and Fasterâ€� concept. Surprisingly, schedule has become more important than cost. Organizations have to fight with the â€œtime to marketâ€�, â€œrespond to competitor's threatsâ€�, and â€œurgent needsâ€�. On one hand, project managers will not only have to find a way to make things work through the expedited lane, but also have to understand what factors are the accelerators and what are hindrances to the system development schedules. On the other hand, they have to ensure that these expedited processes will not lead to technical debt, especially in the areas of future flexibility, degradation of existing capabilities, or rework. This paper will report about the enablers and inhibitors and their estimated impact levels of three types of the expedited systems and software development a) New Single System b) Existing Single System and c) System of Systems."

These new requirements include the need for diverse and complex sensor systems that present demands for energy and computational resources, as well as for broadband communication. To satisfy application demands while maintaining critical support for low-energy operation, a new multiprocessor node hardware and software architecture, Low Power Energy Aware Processing (LEAP), has been developed. In this article, we described the LEAP design approach, in which the system is able to adaptively select the most energy-efficient hardware components matching an application’s needs. The LEAP platform supports highly dynamic requirements in sensing fidelity, computational load, storage media, and network bandwidth. It focuses on episodic operation of each component and considers the energy dissipation for each platform task by integrating fine-grained energy-dissipation monitoring and sophisticated power-control scheduling for all subsystems, including sensors. In addition to the LEAP platform’s unique hardware capabilities, its software architecture has been designed to provide an easy way to use power management interface and a robust, fault-tolerant operating environment and to enable remote upgrade of all software components. LEAP platform capabilities are demonstrated by example implementations, such as a network protocol design and a light source event detection algorithm. Through the use of a distributed node testbed, we demonstrate that by exploiting high energy-efficiency components and enabling proper on-demand scheduling, the LEAP architecture may meet both sensing performance and energy dissipation objectives for a broad class of applications."

In order to engage the Net generation with this topic, we propose development and population of a community-driven Web database containing summaries of empirical software engineering studies. We also present our experience with integrating these activities into a graduate software engineering course. These efforts resulted in the creation of â€œSEEDS: Software Engineering Evidence Database Systemâ€�. Graduate students initially populated \{SEEDS\} with 216 summaries of empirical software engineering studies. The summaries were randomly sampled and reviewed by industry professionals who found the student-written summaries to be at least as useful as professional-written summaries. In fact, 30% more of the respondents found the student-written summaries to be â€œvery usefulâ€�. Motivations, student and instructor-developed prototypes, and assessments of the resulting artifacts will be discussed."
1135.0,Excluded,ec3,Engineering model transformations with transML,"Model transformation is one of the pillars of model-driven engineering (MDE). The increasing complexity of systems and modelling languages has dramatically raised the complexity and size of model transformations as well. Even though many transformation languages and tools have been proposed in the last few years, most of them are directed to the implementation phase of transformation development. In this way, even though transformations should be built using sound engineering principles—just like any other kind of software—there is currently a lack of cohesive support for the other phases of the transformation development, like requirements, analysis, design and testing. In this paper, we propose a unified family of languages to cover the life cycle of transformation development enabling the engineering of transformations. Moreover, following an MDE approach, we provide tools to partially automate the progressive refinement of models between the different phases and the generation of code for several transformation implementation languages."

By a comparison with other proposed interfaces, we argue that our considerations can be applied beyond the example project."
1138.0,Excluded,ec3,Engineering the social: The role of shared artifacts,"This paper presents a multidisciplinary approach to engineering socio-technical design. The paper addresses technological design for social interactions that are non-instrumental, and thereby sometimes contradictory or surprising and difficult to model. Through cooperative analysis of cultural probe data and development of agent-oriented software engineering (AOSE) models, ethnographers and software engineers participate in conversations around shared artifacts, which facilitate the transition from data collected in a social environment to a socially oriented requirements analysis for informing socio-technical design. To demonstrate how this transition was made, we present a case study of the process of designing technology to support familial relationships, such as playing, gifting, showing, telling and creating memories. The case study is based on data collected in a cultural probes study that explores the diverse, complex and unpredictable design environment of the home. A multidisciplinary team worked together through a process of conversations around shared artifacts to cooperatively analyze collected data and develop models. These conversations provided the opportunity to view the data from the perspective of alternative disciplines that resulted in the emergence of novel understandings and innovative practice. The artifacts in the process included returned probe items, scrapbooks, videos of interviews, photographs, family biographies and the \{AOSE\} requirements models. When shared between the two communities of practice, some of these artifacts played important roles in mediating discussions of mutual influence between ethnographers and software engineers. The shared artifacts acted as both triggers for conversations and information vesselsâ€”providing a variety of interpretable objects enabling both sides to articulate their understandings in different ways and to collaboratively negotiate understandings of the collected data. Analyzing the interdisciplinary exchange provided insight into the identification of bridging elements that allowed â€˜the socialâ€™ to permeate the processes of analysis, requirements elicitation and design."
1139.0,Excluded,ec3,Engineering-based processes and agile methodologies for software development: a comparative case study,"The emergence of various software development methodologies raises the need to evaluate and compare their efficiencies. One way of performing such a comparison is to have different teams apply different process models in the implementation of multiple versions of common specifications. This study defines a new cognitive activity classification scheme which has been used to record the effort expended by six student teams producing parallel implementations of the same software requirements specifications. Three of the teams used a process based on the Unified Process for Education (UPEDU), a teaching-oriented process derived from the Rational Unified Process. The other three teams used a process built around the principles of the Extreme Programming (XP) methodology. Important variations in effort at the cognitive activity level between teams shows that the classification could scarcely be used without categorization at a higher level. However, the relative importance of a category of activities aimed at defining â€œactiveâ€� behaviour was shown to be almost constant for all teams involved, possibly showing a fundamental behaviour pattern. As secondary observations, aggregate variations by process model tend to be small and limited to a few activities, and coding-related activities dominate the effort distribution for all the teams."

Agile software development emerged as a result of these studies. Agile practice is a customer oriented, light-weight software development paradigm, best suited for small size development teams in projects under vague and changing requirements. Parallel to this, LEAN manufacturing introduced a massive paradigm shift to production processes in different industries. Later, the LEAN software development, a derived process from LEAN manufacturing emerged. Despite its main focus on defect minimization, it was considered another facet of agile practice due to the flexibility offered by both. In this study we emphasize the key differences between the two practices and examine the possible improvements to the agile software development from LEAN principles that ultimately leads to a hybrid practice.

Due to the inherent trade-off between recall and precision, such methods cannot achieve a high coverage without also retrieving a great number of false positives, causing a significant drop in result accuracy. In this paper, we propose an approach to improving the quality of candidate link generation for the requirements tracing process. We base our research on the cluster hypothesis which suggests that correct and incorrect links can be grouped in high-quality and low-quality clusters respectively. Result accuracy can thus be enhanced by identifying and filtering out low-quality clusters. We describe our approach by investigating three open-source datasets, and further evaluate our work through an industrial study. The results show that our approach outperforms a baseline pruning strategy and that improvements are still possible."

More and more customers were proposing `partnership' model. One of the focus areas in partnership was `requirements engineering' as the challenges faced in this area were affecting both iGATE and its customers. In spite of iGATE having established process and tools, some of the critical projects experienced cost and schedule overruns due to missed requirements. While the conventional Root Cause Analysis (RCA) approach resulted in incremental benefits, an integrated approach to tackle the challenge was the need of the hour. The paper portrays how a robust Requirements Framework was evolved over a period of one and half years crossing several milestones on its journey such as integration of training and technology, project execution and facilitation. The results of implementation was (i) increase in completely owned development projects from 2% to 12%, (ii) increase in resources engaged in requirements phase of project from 8% to 24% and (iii) improved annual organization level customer satisfaction results. Growing by its strength, the organization at present is not only leveraging the requirements framework for successful execution of projects within iGATE.

Unfortunately, the traditional elicitation practices do not scale well when applied to larger projects, where knowledge is distributed across numerous geographically dispersed stakeholders. As a result, new distributed requirements elicitation tools have started to surface, such as online forums and wiki pages. In our previous work, we introduced a framework for supporting distributed elicitation by utilizing data mining and machine learning techniques to automatically group stakeholder ideas into forums, and by using recommender system technologies to help promote these forums to potentially interested stakeholders. The framework is designed to create an open and more inclusive environment where points of view, conflicts, interests and tradeoffs are identified as early as possible.

To resolve this problem and allow situational method engineering, we have defined a set of method fragments in support of the engineering of the project-specific service-oriented software development processes. We have derived the proposed method fragments from the recurring features of 11 prominent service-oriented software development methodologies using a systematic mining approach.

Comparisons of business process modeling notations with regard to their concepts do exist, but to our knowledge, little evaluation has taken place regarding their effectiveness and efficiency for typical requirements engineering tasks. Therefore, we set up experiments examining UML activity diagrams (ACTs) and event-driven process chains (EPCs) both from a requirements engineer's perspective with a focus on model creation and from a customer's or end user's perspective with a focus on model understandability. The experiments were conducted as a blocked subject-object study, where the participants had to solve several characteristic tasks.

We present a case study of the Girl Game Workshop, a game development event intended to empower young women through game design and to promote diversity in game creation. While conducting the workshop, the organisers encountered numerous issues, which presented challenges to their assumptions of the desirability of an emphasis on equality during game design and development. In this paper, we focus on seven key themes relating to equality that emerged from an ethnography conducted during the workshop, including location, cultural and classroom hierarchies, gender, ""girl games"", stakeholders and boundaries, and risk mitigation."

It divides the development period into short time frames called iterations and uses a body of knowledge obtained from past experience called practice to ensure agile software development Although the iteration length is an important factor in agile development however it has so far been decided by the qualitatively and it has been reported that projects with an inappropriate iteration length tends to be failed. We thus propose a new methodology for estimating an appropriate iteration length through the conduct on of a simulation based on project constraints. In this paper we first, propose a method of calculating an appropriate iteration length for a particular project to promote the easy use of agile development. Second, the relationship between the iteration length and project constraints was investigated by varying the parameters to create diverse situations."

This is particularly evident in systems analysis, design, and development methodologies. This paper asks if it is possible that the lack of emphasis upon ethical considerations in development methodologies can result in the failure of advanced technology development projects? In order to explore this contention, the paper sets out the findings of a case study of a large-scale advanced technology project in a multinational engineering company involving the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system. The research examined the extent to which ethical issues emerged in the project and assesses the impact of ethical considerations upon the technology development process and its outcomes. Evidence is presented which shows how ethical concerns clearly impacted upon the outcome of the project, supporting the contention that ethics was a success factor in the case presented. However, it was also clear that the kinds of ethical considerations that emerged were highly complex, and associated with an “ethics of care”. The findings suggested that researchers should examine the potential of an “ethics of care” as a way of complimenting the “ethics of rights” currently dominant within engineering ethics."

The basic assumption is that ethnography through questioning the prevailing conceptions of 'users' and their practices can encourage development engineers to solve the right problems with socially sustainable solutions. However, engineering is solution-driven, with the currency of negotiation being requirement specifications and solution principles. While providing ethnographic insight and recommendations is surely ideal and appropriate in many cases, there are situations, in which a bolder engagement is called for to ensure an impact on the development process. In this paper we explore how video can function to initiate 'requirement specs' discussions rather than just as inspiration or field data. We investigate how video specs can support an engineering development process, and help set clear limitations for which solutions might work, and which might not, while retaining some of the richness of the field studies."

Still, there is a general discontent regarding the way performance is evaluated in practice, with few studies really focusing on why this is the case. In this paper research focusing on the context of developing software-intensive products in large established multi-national organizations is reported on. Objective The purpose of this research is to investigate performance measurement practices related to software product development activities. More specifically, focus is on exploring how managers engaged in software product development activities perceive and evaluate performance in large organizations from a managerial perspective. Method The research approach pursued in this research consist of exploratory multiple case studies. Data is collected mainly through 54 interviews in five case studies in large international organizations developing software-intensive products in Sweden. Focused group interviews with senior managers from eight companies have also been used in the data collection. Results The results of this research indicate that managers within software product development in general are dissatisfied with their current way of evaluating performance. Performance measurements and the perception of performance are today focused on cost, time, and quality, i.e. what is easily measurable and not necessarily what is important. The dimensions of value creation and learning are missing. Moreover, measurements tend to be result oriented, rather than process oriented, making it difficult to integrate these measurements in the management practices. Conclusion Managers that are dissatisfied with their performance measurement system and want to improve the current situation should not start by focusing on the current measurements directly; instead they should focus on how the organization perceives performance and how important performance criteria are being developed. By developing relevant performance criteria the first step in developing an effective performance measurement system is made. Moreover, it is concluded that managerâ€™s perception of performance is affected by the currently used measurements, hence limiting the scope of the performance criteria. Thus, a change in the way managers perceive performance is necessary before there can be any changes in the way performance is evaluated."
1172.0,Excluded,ec3,Evaluating performances of pair designing in industry,"Pair programming has attracted an increasing interest from practitioners and researchers: there is initial empirical evidence that it has positive effects on quality and overall delivery time, as demonstrated by several controlled experiments. The practice does not only regard coding, since it can be applied to any other phase of the software process: analysis, design, and testing. Because of the asymmetry between design and coding, applying pair programming to the design phase might not produce the same benefits as those it produces in the development phase. In this paper, we report the findings of a controlled experiment on pair programming, applied to the design phase and performed in a software company. The results of the experiment suggest that pair programming slows down the task, yet improves quality. Furthermore we compare our results with those of a previous exploratory experiment involving students, and we demonstrate how the outcomes exhibit very similar trends."
1173.0,Excluded,ec3,Evaluating Test-Driven Development in an Industry-Sponsored Capstone Project,"Test-Driven Development (TDD) is an agile development process wherein automated tests are created before production code is designed or constructed in short, rapid iterations. This paper discusses an experiment conducted with undergraduate students in a year-long software engineering capstone course. In this course the students designed, implemented, deployed, and maintained a software system to meet the requirements of an industry sponsor who served as the customer. The course followed an incremental process in which features were added incrementally under the direction of the industry sponsor and the professor. The fourteen students observed in the study were divided into three teams. Among the three teams were two experimental groups. One group consisted of two teams that applied a Test-First (TDD) methodology, while a control group applied a traditional Test-Last methodology. Unlike Test-First, the tests in Test-Last are written after the design and construction of the production code being tested. Results from this experiment differ from many previous studies. In particular, the Test-Last team was actually more productive and wrote more tests than their Test-First counterparts. Anecdotal evidence suggests that factors other than development approach such as individual ambition and team motivation may have more affect than the development approach applied. Although more students indicated a preference for the Test-First approach, concerns regarding learning and applying TDD with unfamiliar technologies are noted."

This paper is related to the evaluation of the quality of functional requirements specifications, focusing on completeness and granularity. To do this, several concepts related to conceptual model quality are presented; these concepts lead to the definition of metrics that allow measuring certain aspects of a requirements model quality (e.g. degree of functional encapsulations completeness with respect to a reference model, number of functional fragmentation errors). A laboratory experiment with master students has been carried out, in order to compare (using the proposed metrics) two RE approaches; namely, Use Cases and Communication Analysis. Results indicate greater quality (in terms of completeness and granularity) when communication analysis guidelines are followed. Moreover, interesting issues arise from experimental results, which invite further research."

However, in a large, distributed organization, such as Nokia Siemens Networks, an agile transformation may be a long-term, complex process, and therefore, evaluating the benefits achieved, and measuring the success of the change, can be difficult, especially in the early phases of the transformation. This paper is based on the results of a case study on the impact introducing agile practices actually had in a large, software-development organization, part of Nokia Siemens Networks. The impact of this agile transformation was evaluated in terms of how well it succeeded in achieving the goals set by the management before the transformation started. This longitudinal study included two separate analyses, made at 6 monthly intervals, which measured what agile practices were really in use in the organization, and what effects, if any, were visible in terms of the goals which had been set by the management The 6 monthly analyses included defect data metrics and opinion surveys of the personnel directly involved in the transformation. The study showed two things: firstly, that the introduction of agile practices does have the beneficial effects that one would expect, and secondly, that, using this kind of study, it is not only possible to evaluate the impact that the adoption of agile practices has in a large, established software-development company, but also that the effects are visible at a surprisingly early stage."

Lai, Evaluating the system intelligence of the intelligent building systems â€” Part 1: Development of key intelligent indicators and assessment approaches, (submitted and under review)]. Two multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approaches, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and analytic network process (ANP), were employed in this study to evaluate the system intelligence of the intelligent building systems. \{AHP\} was utilized to determine the relative importance of the intelligent attributes and indicators in the model, while the \{ANP\} supermatrix was employed to examine the interdependence between the intelligent attributes and the operational benefits of the intelligent building system. A comparison of findings obtained from \{AHP\} and \{ANP\} approaches indicated that most of the values of the intelligent indicators changed. The interdependence between operational goals/benefits and the intelligent attributes modified the original ratings obtained from AHP. The \{ANP\} approach allows inclusive decision making on the system intelligence. Such approach not only examines the intelligent properties of intelligent building systems, but also considers the operational benefits brought by intelligent technologies. The paper uses the integrated building management system (IBMS) as an illustrative example to present a framework. The proposed analytical model is illustrated with an example to demonstrate its assessment procedures and test its effectiveness in application."

The first assessments were carried out using a standard process assessment model (a pre-version of \{ISO\} 18529); the last assessments were carried out using a new \{KESSU\} model that evolved during the research. It was found that the assessment model, its interpretation, and the viewpoints of the assessment team have a critical role in the success of assessments. In addition, it was found that the customers have different purposes for assessments and those purposes have an effect on how one should conduct the assessmentâ€”or whether to conduct it at all."

Deeming a system to be safe involves gathering convincing evidence to argue the safe operation of the system, usually according to the requirements of some safety standard. To handle large collections of safety evidence effectively, practitioners need knowledge of how to classify different types of evidence, how to structure the evidence to show fulfilment of standards' requirements, and how to assess the evidence. However, the notion of evidence is vague and safety standards' requirements can be ambiguous and difficult to understand. Major problems also arise when a system evolves, as the body of safety evidence has to be adequately maintained in order to ensure system safety and allow its demonstration. In this context, this PhD aims to propose a framework for safety evidence management in evolutionary scenarios. The thesis work will concentrate on devising a model-based and customizable infrastructure for storage, manipulation, reuse, and analysis of evolving safety evidence. The infrastructure will be developed and evaluated in the scope of OPENCOSS a large-scale European research project."

1185.0,Excluded,ec7,Evolutionary design of user interfaces for workflow information systems,"Abstract In this paper we argue that user interface design should evolve from iterative to evolutionary in order to support the user interface development life cycle in a more flexible way. Evolutionary design consists of taking any input that informs to the lifecycle at any level of abstraction and its propagation through inferior and superior levels (vertical engineering) as well as the same level (horizontal engineering). This lifecycle is particularly appropriate when requirements are incomplete, partially unknown or to be discovered progressively. We exemplify this lifecycle by a methodology for developing user interfaces of workflow information systems. The methodology involves several models (i.e., task, process, workflow, domain, context of use) and steps. The methodology applies model-driven engineering to derive concrete user interfaces from a workflow model imported into a workflow management system in order to run the workflow. Instead of completing each model step by step, any model element is either derived from early requirements or collected in the appropriate model before being propagated in the subsequent steps. When more requirements are elicited, any new element is added at the appropriate level, consolidated with the already existing elements, and propagated to the subsequent levels. A workflow editor has been developed to support the methodology."

At this early stage of development, only overall goals of features are understood, and there is a need to discover all possible scenarios of operation. We have developed a formalism - Structured Transition Systems (STS) - that facilitates the rapid evolution of specifications. STS supports multiple idioms of specification : transitions, state-diagrams, scenarios etc. It also supports constructs for hierarchical organization of a specification. We have further defined analyses that are useful for review and inspection of STS specifications. A distinctive feature of our method is the ability to use analysis results to refine and reinforce parts of the specification by importing analysis results into STS specifications. In practice, this leads to a feedback loop where requirements can be rapidly refined using analysis engines to drive the development of requirements. We have experimented using our technique on a number of automotive case-studies, and we present some of our experiences with these case-studies."

Over the past several years numerous methodologies have been developed, which attempt to rectify this deficiency (e.g. the Spiral model, the Rational Unified Process (RUP), and Agile methodologies like eXtreme Programming (XP)). XP significantly differs from RUP's prescriptive approach by underemphasizing the role of explicit analysis and design artifacts, and focusing instead on techniques that quickly achieve a ""working system.""

We reported in a previous work a stress testing methodology to detect performance-related Real-Time (RT) faults in DRTSâ€™s based on the design \{UML\} model of a System Under Test (SUT). The stress methodology aimed at increasing the chances of \{RT\} failures (violations in \{RT\} constraints). Objective After stress testing a \{SUT\} and finding \{RT\} faults, an important immediate question is how to fix (debug) those \{RT\} faults and prevent the same \{RT\} violations in the future and after deployment. If appropriate solutions to this challenge cannot be found, stress testing and its findings (detection of \{RT\} faults) will be of no or little use to the quality assurance goals of the development team. Method To move towards systematically solving performance-related problems causing \{RT\} faults, we develop a customized version of the standard Software Performance Engineering process and conduct an experiment on a DRTS. The process is iteratively applied to a SUT, while results from stress testing reveal that there are still scenarios in which \{RT\} constraints are violated. Results Application of the performance engineering paradigm in this context on a real \{DRTS\} enables systematic analysis of performance-related defects and their fixations. Conclusion The contributions of this work are an initial approach to software performance engineering based on stress testing, and an analysis, based on experimentation, of the open issues that need to be addressed in order to improve the approach."

With agile methodologies gaining more wide spread acceptance, such organizations cannot stay away from them. There are concerns about combining agile methodologies with offshoring. There are also concerns about mismatch of agile methodologies with CMMI framework. In this paper we have looked at the problem from the perspective of an offshore software development organization and recounted our experience in adopting agile methodology in executing fixed price agile project. The challenges we have faced comes from three different dimensions. First is to address the issue of having an agile team split across two different countries. The second is to execute the agile project within the framework prescribed under CMMI. Here the challenge is not only to address the actual gap between CMMI and agile methodologies but also to address the perceived shortcomings of agile methodologies. The third dimension is to execute the project as a fixed price one where the requirement is not frozen at the beginning of the project. We have listed the challenges that we have faced. They can be categorized under requirements management, contract management, team management, distributed working, when to design, role of a specialist, testing challenges and CMMI adherence.

Our pragmatic techniques helped with NFR reconciliation and management, and improved the quality of the NFR definitions. The quality of the NFR specifications has permitted automation of the platform performance testing for the past two years."
1201.0,Included,included,Experiences in Scaling the Product Owner Role in Large-Scale Globally Distributed Scrum,"The Product Owner in Scrum is a crucial role responsible for managing customer requirements in the form of prioritized backlog items and communicating them to the Scrum team. When scaling Scrum to large projects consisting of tens of teams, one Product Owner is not able to work with all the teams; thus the role needs to be scaled. While the literature suggests different scaling approaches, e.g. the use of Area Product Owners, reported experiences of scaling this role are scarce. Based on 58 semi-structured interviews, we report experiences of scaling the Product Owner role in two large globally distributed projects, each with 20 or more Scrum teams. Lessons learned include having local product owner representatives at each site, forming a product owner team, relying on frequent communication between the Product Owner representatives and the Scrum teams, as well as keeping and communicating clear priorities of the backlog to all stakeholders."
1202.0,Included,included,Experiences integrating sophisticated user experience design practices into agile processes,"Most significant software processes involve a wide range of disciplines, from programming to testing, and from documentation to database development. Unfortunately, agile processes are typically presented from the point of view of programmers, with the other disciplines often left feeling excluded and disenfranchised. One such discipline is that of user experience design (often abbreviated UED), a discipline encompassing several key specialties including user research, interface design, visual design and usability testing. UED activities span the full lifecycle of product development from early requirements analysis to construction and testing, spanning both large scale system issues and detailed components, with its work products forming key inputs and deliverables of many development activities. In this experience report, we discuss the author's coaching experiences integrating sophisticated UED practices into the agile process initiatives of several organizations. His background is initially that of a programmer and later that of an agile process coach, and we'll explore his journey understanding UED practices and how they map to popular agile processes, mainly Scrum in ""agile software development with Scrum"" by K. Schwaber and M. Beedle (2002) and extreme programming in ""extreme programming explained: embrace change"" by K. Beck (2000). We'll chronicle the teams' struggles to come to grips with the often programming centric orientation of agile processes, and their ongoing efforts to integrate their UED best practices into the incremental, collaborative world of agile processes."

Today the software organization adapted many development methodologies, beginning from waterfall, scrum, v-model, iterative to agile development methodologies, different frameworks, design tools, and domain model tools. But the foremost role and deciding factor for success or failure of the software is largely depends on the Domain Experts (Architects, Business Analyst, Design Engineers and Stack Holders), in the current software realization. This paper will attempt to design and develop an expert system to assist the software developer in the complete software development life cycle with multiple domain experts' such as Telecom, Banking, Insurance, Logistics, Healthcare, Satellite and many more knowledge acquisition. The specific goals of this research include knowledge acquisition specific to the problems of using multiple domain experts, design and development of a prototype expert system for software development, and validation of the prototype expert system."
1211.0,Excluded,ec3,Exploring a Bayesian and linear approach to requirements traceability,"Context For large software projects it is important to have some traceability between artefacts from different phases (e.g.requirements, designs, code), and between artefacts and the involved developers. However, if the capturing of traceability information during the project is felt as laborious to developers, they will often be sloppy in registering the relevant traceability links so that the information is incomplete. This makes automated tool-based collection of traceability links a tempting alternative, but this has the opposite challenge of generating too many potential trace relationships, not all of which are equally relevant. Objective This paper evaluates how to rank such auto-generated trace relationships. Method We present two approaches for such a ranking: a Bayesian technique and a linear inference technique. Both techniques depend on the interaction event trails left behind by collaborating developers while working within a development tool. Results The outcome of a preliminary study suggest the advantage of the linear approach, we also explore the challenges and potentials of the two techniques. Conclusion The advantage of the two techniques is that they can be used to provide traceability insights that are contextual and would have been much more difficult to capture manually. We also present some key lessons learnt during this research."

Our results show that the tree-based models executing on a Virtex 4 field programmable gate array (FPGA) at 82.7 MHz with fixed-point arithmetic can run over 160 times faster than a Core2 Duo processor at 2.2 GHz. The FPGA implementation is two times faster than the nVidia Geforce 7900GTX processor with 24 pipelines at 650 MHz, and 27%--35% slower than the nVidia Geforce 8600GTS processor with 32 Pipelines at 1450 MHz.

How do we increase the friendliness of your mobile phone, in order to fulfil this promise? In this paper, we explore how context awareness can be used for managing the user mobile experience. To this end, we employed a design research approach to integrate context-aware and cloud based services in an Android application. Through a user evaluation and proof-of-concept implementation we show how new technologies can increase the friendliness of your mobile phone. In so doing, we provide evidence that adaptive applications based on user context offer a fertile ground for taking mobile companionship to the next level."

1218.0,Excluded,ec7,Exploring the benefits of the combination of a software architecture analysis and a usability evaluation of a mobile application,"Designing easy to use mobile applications is a difficult task. In order to optimize the development of a usable mobile application, it is necessary to consider the mobile usage context for the design and the evaluation of the userâ€“system interaction of a mobile application. In our research we designed a method that aligns the inspection method â€œSoftware ArchitecTure analysis of Usability Requirements realizatioNâ€� \{SATURN\} and a mobile usability evaluation in the form of a user test. We propose to use mobile context factors and thus requirements as a common basis for both inspection and user test. After conducting both analysis and user test, the results described as usability problems are mapped and discussed. The mobile context factors identified define and describe the usage context of a mobile application. We exemplify and apply our approach in a case study. This allows us to show how our method can be used to identify more usability problems than with each method separately. Additionally, we could confirm the validity and identified the severity of usability problems found by both methods. Our work presents how a combination of both methods allows to address usability issues in a more holistic way. We argue that the increased quantity and quality of results can lead to a reduction of the number of iterations required in early stages of an iterative software development process."

Our goal was to examine students' perceptions of computer mediated scripted collaboration and furthermore to evaluate the effectiveness of adaptive role switching in students' participation. The study showed that students' attitude toward distributed pair programming and scripted collaboration was quite positive, however they prefer to distribute tasks by themselves which led half of them not to follow system's suggestions for role distribution."

1222.0,Excluded,ec3,Exploring the underlying aspects of pair programming: The impact of personality,"With the recent advent of agile software process methods, a number of seldom used and unorthodox practices have come to the forefront in the field of computer programming. One such practice is that of pair programming, which is characterized by two programmers sharing the same computer for collaborative programming purposes. The very nature of pair programming implies a psychological and social interaction between the participating programmers and thus brings into play a unique element that we do not see with the conventional individual programming model. This paper focuses on the effects that one of these psychosocial factors, a programmerâ€™s personality type, may have on the pair programming environment. In this study, a group of university students, 68 undergraduate students and 60 masterâ€™s degree graduate students, each of whom had been personality type profiled using the Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) model, was split into three sub-groups. One group consisted of subjects who were alike in \{MBTI\} type. Another group consisted of subjects who were opposite to each other in \{MBTI\} type, and the last group was comprised of subjects who were diverse â€“ partially alike and partially opposite â€“ in \{MBTI\} type. Through two pair programming sessions, the pairs in each group were assessed for their output, in code productivity. The result showed that the sub-group of subjects who were diverse in \{MBTI\} type exhibited higher productivity than both alike and opposite groups. In a comparison between alike and opposite groups, the productivity of the opposite group was greater than that of the alike group."

More specifically, these steps result in two new security-specific flavours of XP User stories: Abuser stories (threat scenarios) and Security-related User stories (security functionalities). The introduced extensions also aid in formulating security-specific coding and design standards to be used in the project, as well as in understanding the need for supporting specific Security-related User stories by the system. The proposed extensions have been tested in a student project."
1226.0,Excluded,ec3,Extensible Prototyping for pragmatic engineering of knowledge-based systems,"Knowledge-based systems (KBSs) have been built and practically applied in various contexts for decades. Yet, they still challenge developers by their complexity: Apart from a sound knowledge base they likewise require comprehensive user interface (UI) and interaction design for supporting the task at hand optimally. However, current KBS-Engineering methodologies still mostly focus on knowledge base development, regarding UI/interaction design a more incidental, low priority task. Thus, the \{UI\} often is developed in a rather ad hoc manner, thereby neglecting the potential of experimental design and creating reusable solutions. The integration of (rapid) evolutionary prototyping activities with \{KBS\} Engineering offers the chance for incorporating UI/interaction design more prominently into the process while at the same time leveraging the overall development task; specifically, we propose Extensible Prototyping as a tailored prototyping approach and we suggest its integration with the Agile Process Model for knowledge-based systems in this paper. For practical support, we further introduce the customized prototyping and knowledge systems engineering tool ProKEt, and we report on practical experiences with applying both the approach and the tool."

Extreme designing follows on the footsteps of agile methods and is analogous to extreme programming. However, it is not radically committed to ""user interface coding"" (sketching or prototyping alone), but instead proposes to combine user interface sketches with a more structured representation such as an interaction model. By doing so, it brings together the advantages of sketching and prototyping as a communication tool, and of interaction modeling as a glue that binds together the sketches to allow designers to gain a more comprehensive view of and to reflection on the interactive artifact, thus promoting a more coherent and consistent set of design decisions."

I will start by discussing the characteristics of critical systems development, such as the need to justify claims about the system dependability, and the differences in development culture between XP and critical systems development. I will then go on to discuss how different XP practices reduce or increase the risks of software failure, especially when the reality of implementing XP is considered. I will identify weaknesses in the XP process, such as the use of user stories for requirements definition, that have to be addressed before XP practices will be considered by the critical systems community. I will then suggest how the cultural barriers between the communities might be broken down and will propose how it might be possible to adapt XP practice to the development of some types of critical system by introducing 'dependability spikes' into the XP process.

1237.0,Included,included,Extreme programming modified: embrace requirements engineering practices,"Extreme programming (XP) is an agile (lightweight) software development methodology and it becomes more and more popular. XP proposes many interesting practices, but it also has some weaknesses. From the software engineering point of view the most important issues are: maintenance problems resulting from very limited documentation (XP relies on code and test cases only), and lack of wider perspective of a system to be built. Moreover, XP assumes that there is only one customer representative. In many cases there are several representatives (each one with his own view of the system and different priorities) and then some XP practices should be modified. In the paper we assess XP from two points of view: the capability maturity model and the Sommerville-Sawyer model (1997). We also propose how to introduce documented requirements to XP, how to modify the planning game to allow many customer representatives and how to get a wider perspective of a system to be built at the beginning of the project lifecycle."
1238.0,Included,included,Extreme programming of multi-agent systems,"The complexity of communication scenarios between agents make multi-agent systems difficult to build. Most of the existing Agent-Oriented Software Engineering methodologies face this complexity by guiding the developers through a rather waterfall-based process with a series of intermediate modeling artifacts. While these methodologies lead to executable prototypes relatively late and are expensive when requirements change, we explore a rather evolutionary approach with explicit support for change and rapid feedback. In particular, we apply Extreme Programming, a modern agile methodology from object-oriented software technology, for the design and implementation of multi-agent systems. The only modeling artifacts that are being maintained in our approach are a process model with which domain experts and developers design and communicate agent application scenarios, and the executable agent source code including automated test cases. We have successfully applied our approach for the development of a prototypical multi-agent system for clinical information logistics."

However, recent results suggest that this practice is not followed to the extent preferred by industry. In order to pinpoint specific obstacles limiting its industrial adoption we have conducted a systematic literature review on empirical studies explicitly focusing on TDD as well as indirectly addressing TDD. Our review has identified seven limiting factors viz., increased development time, insufficient TDD experience/knowledge, lack of upfront design, domain and tool specific issues, lack of developer skill in writing test cases, insufficient adherence to TDD protocol, and legacy code. The results of this study is of special importance to the testing community, since it outlines the direction for further detailed scientific investigations as well as highlights the requirement of guidelines to overcome these limiting factors for successful industrial adoption of TDD.

1248.0,Excluded,ec3,Factors that impact implementing an agile software development methodology,"The Internet economy has altered the rules of software engineering. Traditional development methodologies are too cumbersome to meet the rapidly changing requirements and short product cycles demanded by business. To meet these changing requirements, software developers have developed agile software development methodologies (SDMs) utilizing iterative development, prototyping, and templates. This research project investigated agile SDM implementation using an online survey sent to practitioners worldwide. This survey data were used to identify factors related to agile SDM implementation. Factors that included training, management involvement, access to external resources, and corporate size were found to impact implementation of an agile software development methodology. Factors such as using models, having an implementation plan, collocating the development team, and developing software for Internet or intranet use did not impact the implementation of an agile software development methodology. Several of the factors that impact the implementation of an agile development methodology are under the control of management. Organizations considering the implementation of an agile methodology may wish to manipulate some of these factors to increase the opportunities for success of their methodology."
1251.0,Excluded,ec3,Failure prediction based on log files using Random Indexing and Support Vector Machines,"Research problem The impact of failures on software systems can be substantial since the recovery process can require unexpected amounts of time and resources. Accurate failure predictions can help in mitigating the impact of failures. Resources, applications, and services can be scheduled to limit the impact of failures. However, providing accurate predictions sufficiently ahead is challenging. Log files contain messages that represent a change of system state. A sequence or a pattern of messages may be used to predict failures. Contribution We describe an approach to predict failures based on log files using Random Indexing (RI) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Method \{RI\} is applied to represent sequences: each operation is characterized in terms of its context. \{SVMs\} associate sequences to a class of failures or non-failures. Weighted \{SVMs\} are applied to deal with imbalanced datasets and to improve the true positive rate. We apply our approach to log files collected during approximately three months of work in a large European manufacturing company. Results According to our results, weighted \{SVMs\} sacrifice some specificity to improve sensitivity. Specificity remains higher than 0.80 in four out of six analyzed applications. Conclusions Overall, our approach is very reliable in predicting both failures and non-failures."

1255.0,Excluded,ec3,Fault-based test suite prioritization for specification-based testing,"Context Existing test suite prioritization techniques usually rely on code coverage information or historical execution data that serve as indicators for estimating the fault-detecting ability of test cases. Such indicators are primarily empirical in nature and not theoretically driven; hence, they do not necessarily provide sound estimates. Also, these techniques are not applicable when the source code is not available or when the software is tested for the first time. Objective We propose and develop the novel notion of fault-based prioritization of test cases which directly utilizes the theoretical knowledge of their fault-detecting ability and the relationships among the test cases and the faults in the prescribed fault model, based on which the test cases are generated. Method We demonstrate our approach of fault-based prioritization by applying it to the testing of the implementation of logical expressions against their specifications. We then validate our proposal by an empirical study that evaluates the effectiveness of prioritization techniques using two different metrics. Results A theoretically guided fault-based prioritization technique generally outperforms other techniques under study, as assessed by two different metrics. Our empirical results also show that the technique helps to reveal all target faults by executing only about 72% of the prioritized test suite, thereby reducing the effort required in testing. Conclusions The fault-based prioritization approach is not only applicable to the instance empirically validated in this paper, but should also be adaptable to other fault-based testing strategies. We also envisage new research directions to be opened up by our work."

We introduced a process that allows User Interaction Designers and Business Analysts to work in sync with the Developers and QA Analysts within a sprint. Each member of the Feature Team is involved in getting READY, planning, executing and being DONE. By introducing this process, we observed an increase in team morale, better, more predictable results and accumulation of less debt, while at the same time maintaining a constant velocity.

While a number of reports have been published on explaining the XP methodology and the perceived benefits when using XP for system development in recent years, less is known about the actual operationalization of the XP principles. This paper presents an action research study reporting on the experiences of implementing the XP methodology in a development project for a Web-based, distributed information system. The goal of this research was to increase the understanding of how to effectively operationalize XP techniques so that the system being developed catered to today's fast-paced technological environment by allowing the developers to respond quickly to innovative and changing requirements. Overall, the research indicates that most of the XP principles could be effectively implemented; however, three of the principles required modification (i.e., testing, pair programming, customer collocation). Several benefits resulted from the usage of XP. The rapid prototyping enabled information technology developers and users to clarify system requirements, communicate openly, quickly build rapport, and create an interface that was easy to use and learn. Further, the research found that where the technology was new or foreign to the development team and the user, the XP process was flexible enough to support several iterations of technology and produce prototypes in a timely manner. Pair programming appeared to work effectively and offer value; however, it is not always practically feasible. Â© 2006 M.E. Sharpe, Inc."

It is industrial practice to define such requirements in form of natural language (NL) documents. Currently existing approaches to analyzing NL confidentiality requirements rely on a manual linguistic transformation and normalization of the original text, prior to the analysis. This paper presents an alternative approach to analyzing requirements by using semantic annotations placed directly into the original NL documents. The benefits of this alternative approach are twofold: (1) it can effectively be supported by an interactive annotation tool and (2) there is a direct traceability between annotation structures and the original NL documents. We have evaluated our method and tool support using the same real-world case study that was used to evaluate the earlier linguistic approach. Our results show that our method generates the same results, i.e., it uncovers the same problems."

In particular, while most research on design for software focuses on finding some correct solution, this ignores that such a solution is often only correct in a particular, and often short-lived, context. Using a logic-based goal-oriented requirements modeling language, the paper poses the problem of finding desirable solutions as the requirements change. Among other possible criteria of desirability, we consider minimizing the effort required to implement the new solution, which involves reusing parts of the old solution. In general, the solution of requirements problems is viewed as an exploration using a “requirements engineering knowledge base” (REKB), whose specification is formalized. The paper reports on experience implementing the REKB on top of a so-called “reason-maintenance system”, and provides evidence that incremental solution finding is indeed more efficient."

On May 2008 Exigen Services announced the launch of Innovative Fixed-Price Agile Package. Flex-agility is a packaged services offering which combines Agile methodologies with customer-aligned governance and fixed priced commercial terms. This package provides customers certainty in on-time and on-budget delivery, eliminating the difficulty of changing requirements while guaranteeing maximum value from their IT investments. The Flex-agility offering provides for changes to be introduced during any project without impacting the original schedule or budget. Use of Agile methods reduces the financial risks associated with large IT projects by treating the cause of the risk, not simply applying off-shore manpower. The paper examines the experience of running this model and describes the details, know-how and success factors that should be met to work under these types of contracts. At this moment several Fixed Price Agile contracts were completed and running and also this contractual model became standard approach for some of the large customers that have multiple projects running in XS."

By combining theories dealing with risk-sharing under various degrees of uncertainty (financial incentives and long-term relationships) with respect to social influence tactics involved in negotiations concerning additional work and changes, a useful framework was created. Case data regarding Swedish interorganizational development projects from both the construction and \{IT\} industries are used to illustrate the theoretical arguments. Findings indicate that social norms and the work-related values and attitudes of key negotiators significantly affect project outcomes. Efforts to increase the sophistication of financial incentives and long-term arrangements (e.g., standardized routines concerning risk-sharing and collaborative initiatives) do not seem to pay-off."

In order to discuss any subject matter clearly, it is necessary to begin with a clear set of definitions. Indeed much can be gained through careful and consistent definitions of terms alone. Flexibility however is a word rich with ambiguity. While it is being increasingly used in various fields, few attempts have been made to formally define, quantify, and propose ways for achieving flexibility. This paper proposes to fill in part of this gap by synthesizing a clear and consistent definition of flexibility. It will do so by reviewing the usage of the term in various fields of inquiries, and show that it is indeed possible to clearly and unambiguously characterize flexibility, and to disentangle it from closely related concepts."

1275.0,Excluded,ec7,Focusing Spontaneous Feedback to Support System Evolution,"Modern software systems are rarely built from scratch. They rather evolve over a long period of time while components and subsystems are developed independently. During that evolution, new and changing requirements emerge when end-users interact with the system. Users encounter situations that provoke spontaneous complaints or suggestions, which may be the seed of new requirements. However, there are two challenges: How to capture spontaneous reactions and how to focus and let them mature into valid requirements? We propose concepts that enable citizens to report a problem or make a suggestion by Smartphone. A key for preserving the spontaneous impetus is to lower the threshold for composing and sending feedback. Software providers who are interested in feedback can define filtering and focusing aids; they guide end-users in giving focused feedback. Focused feedback is also better prepared to be transformed to requirements. Our ConTexter tool demonstrates technical feasibility of these concepts. We explore and characterize a potential application domain empirically. Based on the findings, we discuss potentials and limitations of our approach."

However, in real-world embedded distributed systems, it can be impossible, impractical, or too costly to gather enough field test data to make these evaluations in a straight-forward manner using traditional system testing alone. Instead, we need a method of verifying requirements compliance that uses the evidence available while minimizing the chances of wrong or misleading conclusions. This paper introduces the novel forensic system verification (FSV) method, which combines modeling, data mining, analytic extrapolation, and goal modeling. It augments human inferences with automated reasoning about requirement satisfaction and confidence propagation. The FSV Method is evaluated on a case study performed using data from a recent medium-scale field trial of a complex distributed embedded system."

1280.0,Excluded,ec7,Formal Analysis of Privacy Requirements Specifications for Multi-tier Applications,"Companies require data from multiple sources to develop new information systems, such as social networking, e-commerce and location-based services. Systems rely on complex, multi-stakeholder data supply-chains to deliver value. These data supply-chains have complex privacy requirements: privacy policies affecting multiple stakeholders (e.g. user, developer, company, government) regulate the collection, use and sharing of data over multiple jurisdictions (e.g. California, United States, Europe). Increasingly, regulators expect companies to ensure consistency between company privacy policies and company data practices. To address this problem, we propose a methodology to map policy requirements in natural language to a formal representation in Description Logic. Using the formal representation, we reason about conflicting requirements within a single policy and among multiple policies in a data supply chain. Further, we enable tracing data flows within the supply-chain. We derive our methodology from an exploratory case study of Facebook platform policy. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in an evaluation involving Facebook, Zynga and AOL-Advertising policies. Our results identify three conflicts that exist between Facebook and Zynga policies, and one conflict within the AOL Advertising policy."
1281.0,Excluded,ec3,Formal model for assigning human resources to teams in software projects,"Context Human resources play a critical role in software project success. However, people are still the least formalized factor in todayâ€™s process models. Generally, people are assigned to roles and project teams are formed on the basis of project leadersâ€™ experience of people, constraints (e.g. availability) and skill requirements. Yet this process has to take multiple factors into account. Few works in the literature model this process. Most of these are informal proposals focusing on the individual assignment of people to project tasks and do not consider other aspects like team formation as a whole. Objective In this paper we formulate a formal model for assigning human resources to software project teams. Additionally, we describe the key results of the knowledge management process enacted to output the elements of the model. Method The model elements were identified using the Delphi expert consultation method and applying psychological tests. The proposed model was implemented in a software tool and validated on two software development organization assignment scenarios. Results We built a formal model for the process of assigning human resources to software project teams. This model takes into account as many factors as possible and aids the assignment of individuals to project roles, as well as the formation of the team as a whole. We found that the rules that were identified to form software development project teams are useful. From the tests we found that model implementation was feasible (all the executions of the implemented problem-solving algorithms output feasible solutions in response times that can be considered as acceptable). Conclusion Using the Delphi method we were able to propose software project roles and competences. Psychological tests and data mining tools identified useful rules for forming software project teams. These were used to build a formal model. This model was built into a tool that returns role assignments in acceptable response times. This decision support tool helps managers assign people to roles and to form teams. Using the tool, project leaders can flexibly evaluate different team make-ups, taking into account several factors, as well as different constraints and objectives."

Therefore, current trace retrieval algorithms tend to produce imprecise and incomplete results. In this paper we address this mismatch by proposing an expert system which integrates a knowledge base of domain concepts and their relationships, a set of logic rules for defining relationships between artifacts based on these rules, and a process for mapping artifacts into a structure against which the rules can be applied. This paper lays down the core foundations needed to integrate an expert system into the automated tracing process. We construct a knowledge base and inference rules for part of a large industrial project in the transportation domain and empirically show that our approach significantly improves precision and recall of the generated trace links."

This wide range of heterogeneous models makes it possible to resolve multiple needs. In recent years, as the integration of different models has increased, organizations have started to note that their business and technical processes can be aligned with more than one model. Currently, however, we are not aware of any other attempts to provide an explicit and systematic solution that would allow us to address the issue of harmonization of multiple reference models in such a way as to satisfy the needs of the companies. In the quest to help support the work of harmonization of multiple models, this paper presents (i) a framework that defines elements needed to support the harmonization of multiple reference models, (ii) a process, which is the backbone and way of integrating all the elements defined in the framework thus allowing the implementation of a harmonization project to be guided systematically, harmonizing multiple models through the configuration of a harmonization strategy, and (iii) a set of methods, which allows us to know â€œwhat to doâ€�, as well as â€œhow to putâ€� two or more models in consonance with each other. The experience of the application of our proposal is illustrated in two case studies. The findings obtained show that the harmonization process has enabled us to harmonize and put the models involved in consonance with each other."

In 2006, Xebia (The Netherlands) started localized projects with half Dutch and half Indian team members. After establishing a localized velocity of five times their waterfall competitors on the same project, they moved the Indian members of the team to India and showed stable velocity with fully distributed teams. The ability to achieve hyperproductivity with distributed, outsourced teams was shown to be a repeatable process and a fully distributed model is now the recommended standard when organizations have disciplined Scrum teams with full implementation of XP engineering practices inside the Scrum. Previous studies used overlapping time zones to ease communication and create a single distributed team. The goal of this report is to go one step further and show the same results with team members separated by the 12.5 hour time difference between India and San Francisco. If Scrum works without overlapping time zones then applying it to the mainstream offshoring practice in North America will be possible. In 2008, Xebia India started engagements with partners like TBD.com, a social networking site in San Francisco.

Several reports from large companies such as Bosch, Nokia, Philips and Siemens witness gains and benefits achieved with their use, especially with respect to the reduction on time to market. In SPL development, domain analysis plays a central role where the relevant features are identified. Feature-Oriented Domain Analysis is a method which uses a feature model to specify variabilities and commonalities of an SPL. However, activities related to the Domain Analysis process (managing commonalities and variabilities, with users visibility and relevant stakeholders) in most cases, do not seem to be a simple and easy activity, since to represent these analyzes in modelling domain tools with a certain degree of formality, requires a technical knowledge that domain experts do not always have it prior to use. But creative requirements techniques have been suggested to facilitate the elicitation activity by filling the gap the communications problems between domain experts and software engineers, making the domain analysis more agile. Thus, to improve the domain analysis process, this paper seeks to set out the use of a creative and agile technique for modelling requirements by means of mind maps for cognitive and effective support when building feature models."

Additionally designers communicate. It takes at least as much time to communicate the design to other people as it does to generate and plan the solution. Where the designer's word is lawâ€”or where there is an interfering \{VP\} or a scatterbrained PMâ€”late feature revelations are disastrous. The \{HCI\} field has strenuously proven in the last 25 years that it is worth the engineering time to generally have high-level design researched and completed before engineering work begins. But in practice, particularly at software companies, the detailed subtleties of interface design are very rarely reason to restructure the database or hold back on launch. And even though product planning typically begins before significant engineering expenditure, the people who do the product planning are very rarely people who are trained in user-centered product design. Designers are often seen as more of an engineering resource: someone to call in when one starts to build, not when one starts to plan. Ellen Beldner is the User Experience director at ChoiceVendor, a business software startup in San Francisco.

This research develops a framework to examine the threat of potential disruptions on supply chain processes and focuses on potential mitigation and supply chain design strategies that can be implemented to mitigate this risk. The framework was developed by integrating three theoretical perspectivesâ€”normal accident theory, high reliability theory, and situational crime prevention. The research uses a multi-method approach to identify key safety and security initiatives (process management, information sharing, and supply chain partner and service provider relationship management) that can be implemented and the conditions under which each initiative is best suited. The research results illustrate that the depth and breadth of security initiatives depends on top management mindfulness, operational complexity, product risk, and coupling."

The question remains, however, if they are equally applicable to the systems and enterprise engineering found in large or complex system environments. This paper builds on previous conceptual work to describe specific applications of the concepts to support coordination of systems engineering activities within large-scale system acquisition, development and evolution. Using a surrogate environment derived from the complex interactions of IT, embedded systems, and human activities in a large multi- facility hospital system, we provide examples of how integrated kanban-like constructs can be created at each systems engineering level from an individual project through the complete capabilities portfolio."

1334.0,Excluded,ec3,Graphical user interface (GUI) testing: Systematic mapping and repository,"AbstractContext \{GUI\} testing is system testing of a software that has a graphical-user interface (GUI) front-end. Because system testing entails that the entire software system, including the user interface, be tested as a whole, during \{GUI\} testing, test casesâ€”modeled as sequences of user input eventsâ€”are developed and executed on the software by exercising the GUIâ€™s widgets (e.g., text boxes and clickable buttons). More than 230 articles have appeared in the area of \{GUI\} testing since 1991. Objective In this paper, we study this existing body of knowledge using a systematic mapping (SM). Method The \{SM\} is conducted using the guidelines proposed by Petersen et al. We pose three sets of research questions. We define selection and exclusion criteria. From the initial pool of 230 articles, published in years 1991â€“2011, our final pool consisted of 136 articles. We systematically develop a classification scheme and map the selected articles to this scheme. Results We present two types of results. First, we report the demographics and bibliometrics trends in this domain, including: top-cited articles, active researchers, top venues, and active countries in this research area. Moreover, we derive the trends, for instance, in terms of types of articles, sources of information to derive test cases, types of evaluations used in articles, etc. Our second major result is a publicly-accessible repository that contains all our mapping data. We plan to update this repository on a regular basis, making it a â€œliveâ€� resource for all researchers. Conclusion Our \{SM\} provides an overview of existing \{GUI\} testing approaches and helps spot areas in the field that require more attention from the research community. For example, much work is needed to connect academic model-based techniques with commercially available tools. To this end, studies are needed to compare the state-of-the-art in \{GUI\} testing in academic techniques and industrial tools."

Even for the case of battery powered devices, where energy conservation is a key design goal, new approaches have been proposed, based on a better understanding of the cost-performance trade-offs introduced by energy efficient operation, while increasingly focusing on emerging communication technologies, e.g., body sensor networks, \{MIMO\} or LTE. This paper presents a survey of the recent proposals for green wireless communications, with a view to understanding the most relevant sources of inefficient energy consumption and how these are tackled by current solutions. We introduce a classification of the existing mechanisms based on their operational time-scale, discuss the most important techniques employed to date from this perspective, analyze the employed evaluation methodologies and undertake a quantitative comparison of their performance gains. Following this analysis, we identify the key challenges yet to be addressed by the research community, as well as several possible future directions towards greener communications."

The game incorporates both the design model and a specification of what it means for the design to be correct. The central idea of this approach is that the designer can increment the game during a play and gradually add more detail to it. Specification and design are refined by repeated plays of the game. The designer stops playing when design and specification are detailed enough for his purpose and match each other. The interactive game approach helps to cope with incompleteness and informal definition of \{UML\} models, which make strictly formal verification techniques difficult. The designer may resolve these problems when they arise during a play or let the \{GUIDE\} tool determine how the play should proceed. We discuss the potential impact of \{GUIDE\} and tools like it on software development."

When I joined the company there was already a Selenium-based test framework in place, but there were only a couple of automated test cases created; we had about 400 test steps, or individual assertions about the behavior of the application. When I left Socialtext two years later, we had just surpassed 10,000 test steps in the main set of regression tests. We also had browser-specific test sets in place, an automated test case for visually checking the application, and a Continuous-Integration-like script that ran all day and all night against the latest version of the code. At about 4000 test steps, regression bugs released to production dropped essentially to zero. The other 6000 test steps covered ongoing new features in the project, and more robust testing of the older application functions. This report discusses how I helped grow this system, and the things we learned along the way that helped it be such a successful ongoing project. The report covers initial conditions and test design; discusses issues in application feature coverage; how and when to grow the system quickly; a couple of test design smells that caused us problems along the way; how we treat Continuous Integration in a system like this; and how we coped when significant parts of the User Interface were completely re-engineered."

This chapter places website quality within the context of the $2.4 trillion U.S. electronic commerce industry. Thus, this chapter provides a history of electronic computers, electronic commerce, software methods, software quality metrics, agile methods and studies on agile methods. None of these histories are without controversy. For instance, some scholars begin the study of the electronic computer by mentioning the emergence of the Sumerian text, Hammurabi code or the abacus. We, however, will align our history with the emergence of the modern electronic computer at the beginning of World War II. The history of electronic commerce also has poorly defined beginnings. Some studies of electronic commerce begin with the widespread use of the Internet in the early 1990s. However, electronic commerce cannot be appreciated without establishing a deeper context. Few scholarly studies, if any, have been performed on agile methods, which is the basic purpose of this literature review. That is, to establish the context to conduct scholarly research within the fields of agile methods and electronic commerce."

If this is so, successful industrial software development should already exhibit agile characteristics. This article therefore aims to examine whether that is the case. It presents an analysis of interviews with software developers from five different companies. We asked about concrete projects, both about the project models and the methods used, but also about the real situation in their daily work. Based on the interviews, we describe and then analyze their development practices. The analysis shows that the software providers we interviewed have more agile practices than they might themselves be aware of. However, plans and more formal development models also are well established. The conclusions answer the question posed in the title: It all depends!

In the context of emerging cloud systems, the question is whether and how the elicitation process differs from that used for traditional systems, and if the current methods suffice. We interviewed 19 cloud providers to gain an in-depth understanding of the state of practice with regard to the adoption and implementation of existing elicitation methods. The results of this exploratory study show that, whereas a few cloud providers try to implement and adapt traditional methods, the large majority uses ad-hoc approaches for identifying consumer needs. There are various causes for this situation, ranging from consumer reachability issues and previous failed attempts, to a complete lack of development strategy. The study suggests that only a small number of the current techniques can be applied successfully in cloud systems, hence showing a need to research new ways of supporting cloud providers. The main contribution of this work lies in revealing what elicitation methods are used by cloud providers and clarifying the challenges related to requirements elicitation posed by the cloud paradigm. Further, we identify some key features for cloud-specific elicitation methods."

These teams applied an adaptation of an agile methodology, eXtreme Programming (XP), to develop a software product. We found that the teams with the highest job satisfaction are precisely the ones whose members score highest for the personality factors agreeableness and conscientiousness. The satisfaction levels are also higher when the members can decide how to develop and organize their work. On the other hand, the level of satisfaction and cohesion drops the more conflict there is between the team members. Finally, the teams exhibit a significant positive correlation between the personality factor extraversion and software product quality."

A retrospective analysis of four mainstream activities,"Context Knowledge transfer is an important responsibility of universities and research institutes as part of their contribution to society. In the field of software engineering, several studies have been performed to show the influence of research in popular technologies such as middleware systems. However, there is no scholarly analysis of the influence that research has had in mainstream activities of current software life cycles. Objective We analyse how methodological research has influenced activities of widespread use in current software life cycles. To keep this goal into manageable bounds, we focus on four very successful trends of current practice: iterative development, architecture-centric development, requirements-driven development, and coherent method integration. Method We follow different forms of evidence backwards in time. As signs of influence we admit the following categories: citations included in papers and standards, interviews, historical essays, people movement, and acquisitions of companies. Results For each one of the mentioned activities, we obtain a trace diagram showing the indirect influence that pieces of research have had in the selected activities of software life cycles. Conclusions Our results support the following claims: (1) mainstream dissemination of the analysed methodological research has taken on the order of 20â€“40 years; (2) interdisciplinarity has been important in the research that influenced some very popular activities of current software life cycles; (3) research on life cycles is more influential when it originates from large development projects; and (4) probably the best results can be obtained if industrial research goes hand in hand with academic research."
1376.0,Excluded,ec7,How Interaction Between Roles Shapes the Communication Structure in Requirements-Driven Collaboration,"Requirements engineering involves collaboration among many project team members. Driven by coordination needs, this collaboration relies on communication and knowledge that members have of their colleagues and related activities. Ineffective coordination with those who work on requirements dependencies may result in project failure. In this paper, we report on a study of roles and communication structures in the collaboration driven by interdependent requirements in a software team. Through on-site observations, interviews with the developers and application of social network analysis, we found that there was significant communication between diverse roles in the project, and identified what were the reasons for communication between the different roles. We also found that these interactions typically involved a core of requirements analysts and testers in close communication, that most often they involved critical members whose absence, whether temporary or permanent, would disrupt the information flow if removed from the project, as well as that new hires were mostly isolated from the team collaboration. Most interestingly we found that the emergent communication structure between the different roles in the project did not conform to the planned communication structure prescribed by the organization. These findings further our knowledge about collaboration driven by requirements, and provide some useful implications for research and development of collaborative tools to support the effective coordination of cross-functional teams in software development."

1379.0,Excluded,ec3,How ontologies are made: Studying the hidden social dynamics behind collaborative ontology engineering projects,"Abstract Traditionally, evaluation methods in the field of semantic technologies have focused on the end result of ontology engineering efforts, mainly, on evaluating ontologies and their corresponding qualities and characteristics. This focus has led to the development of a whole arsenal of ontology-evaluation techniques that investigate the quality of ontologies as a product. In this paper, we aim to shed light on the process of ontology engineering construction by introducing and applying a set of measures to analyze hidden social dynamics. We argue that especially for ontologies which are constructed collaboratively, understanding the social processes that have led to their construction is critical not only in understanding but consequently also in evaluating the ontologies. With the work presented in this paper, we aim to expose the texture of collaborative ontology engineering processes that is otherwise left invisible. Using historical change-log data, we unveil qualitative differences and commonalities between different collaborative ontology engineering projects. Explaining and understanding these differences will help us to better comprehend the role and importance of social factors in collaborative ontology engineering projects. We hope that our analysis will spur a new line of evaluation techniques that view ontologies not as the static result of deliberations among domain experts, but as a dynamic, collaborative and iterative process that needs to be understood, evaluated and managed in itself. We believe that advances in this direction would help our community to expand the existing arsenal of ontology evaluation techniques towards more holistic approaches."

MITRE's Corporate IT Systems Engineering department supports software development activities which recently adopted an agile methodology. Unlike the detailed requirements documentation of more traditional, waterfall-based projects, we have found the streamlined &#x201C;user stories&#x201D; inadequate for developers or testers. Our BA experiences with eliciting user story details and maintaining the backlog for sprint planning are a critical component to agile development. BA activities include grooming the backlog, documenting user stories with detailed contracts, and performing user story verification through testing. This paper will review the techniques we have used during agile projects to manage the sprint cycle, including templates for user story management. Capturing artifacts from other agile projects and documenting recommended agile process guidelines can help projects be successful through reuse and collaboration. Many agile projects generate artifacts that are lost or are created for the benefit of only their project and discarded when through. Agile encourages lean documentation in order to maximize agility. We established a repository using an internal website where we documented corporte IT processes and share agile templates and samples. This repository includes samples of sprint schedules, backlog lists, burn-down charts, retrospective items, and user stories. The corporate IT process recommends agile but also includes traditional waterfall guidance and correlates the two different approaches. All projects, whether they are agile or otherwise, need similar deliverables, including project schedules and project plans. In correlating agile considerations to a waterfall approach, we hope to ease the transition to agile. The process guidance and repository site promotes collaboration, reuse, and review among agile pro- ects within the organization."

It has been suggested to distinguish between so-called “avoidable creep” and “unavoidable creep” where “avoidable creep” results from stopping requirements engineering (RE) effort too early e.g. for cost-saving reasons. However, no suggestion has been made how to assign cost to “avoidable creep” to quantify the consequence of too early stopped RE effort and to get that type of creep managed or even considerably reduced. From our experience in real and large fixed price projects, we derived a suggestion for solving this problem as soon as possible. The suggested solution has not yet been tried out in practice. However, with this paper we would like to begin a discussion about the suggested solution, and whether it could solve the problem of valuating “avoidable creep”, could thereby reduce both the customer's and the supplier's risk in large fixed price projects and, as a side-effect, serves as a step in converging pure waterfall and pure agile procedures."

An Experience Using Data Collection and Feedback,"Several works on agile methods discuss the use of team's workspace for displaying relevant information. The management of an Informative Workspace (IW) is a challenging task as it can involve many different subjects such as team adaptability, continuous reflection, workspace layout, human cognition, usability, etc. Our paper explores the IW management and it is divided in two phases. The first phase describes a data collection performed on 8 agile teams in order to identify valuable aspects on managing an IW based on their experiences. We proposed a series of suggestions to the teams in order to improve their current context using their IW and we gathered the feedbacks. This process leds to a set of seven heuristics for managing an IW. On the second phase, in order to reinforce the heuristics validity, a five point Likert scale survey was applied resulting mostly in positive evaluations. At the end of these two phases, we associate the seven proposed heuristics, when possible, to available considerations on other agile community references."

1391.0,Excluded,ec3,How to steer an embedded software project: tactics for selecting the software process model,"Modern large new product developments (NPD) are typically characterized by many uncertainties and frequent changes. Often the embedded software development projects working on such products face many problems compared to traditional, placid project environments. One of the major project management decisions is then the selection of the project's software process model. An appropriate process model helps coping with the challenges, and prevents many potential project problems. On the other hand, an unsuitable process choice causes additional problems. This paper investigates the software process model selection in the context of large market-driven embedded software product development for new telecommunications equipment. Based on a quasi-formal comparison of publicly known software process models including modern agile methodologies, we propose a process model selection frame, which the project manager can use as a systematic guide for (re)choosing the project's process model. A novel feature of this comparative selection model is that we make the comparison against typical software project problem issues. Some real-life project case examples are examined against this model. The selection matrix expresses how different process models answer to different questions, and indeed there is not a single process model that would answer all the questions. On the contrary, some of the seeds to the project problems are in the process models themselves. However, being conscious of these problems and pitfalls when steering a project enables the project manager to master the situation."

It is important to construct a model that lead to large web applications development with minimum likelihood of failure. A Hybrid web engineering process model for large web development enterprises has been proposed in this research. This model focuses on overall development process phases and consists of many activities: division of large web application into many small sub applications; division of large number of developers into many sub teams; identify a management team to control the development process; Stakeholders' and customers' inclusion and feedback during development process; requirement analysis and management; adopting the Spiral model by management team; adopting the Throwaway Prototype, XP agile method, Web Engineering process model by each sub team; conducting CMMI levels key process areas; conducting web engineering practices and SQA activities; and training developers on CMMI and web engineering practices. An evaluation of this model according to CMMI process areas has been conducted in this research. This evaluation has been carried out by many professional developers currently working in many large web-development Jordanian enterprises. The evaluation results shows that the Hybrid model highly satisfied each of CMMI level2 and CMMI level3, medium satisfaction of CMMI level4, and finally low satisfaction of CMMI level5.

1407.0,Excluded,ec7,Identifying Outdated Requirements Based on Source Code Changes,"Keeping requirements specifications up-to-date when systems evolve is a manual and expensive task. Software engineers have to go through the whole requirements document and look for the requirements that are affected by a change. Consequently, engineers usually apply changes to the implementation directly and leave requirements unchanged. In this paper, we propose an approach for automatically detecting outdated requirements based on changes in the code. Our approach first identifies the changes in the code that are likely to affect requirements. Then it extracts a set of keywords describing the changes. These keywords are traced to the requirements specification, using an existing automated traceability tool, to identify affected requirements. Automatically identifying outdated requirements reduces the effort and time needed for the maintenance of requirements specifications significantly and thus helps preserve the knowledge contained in them. We evaluated our approach in a case study where we analyzed two consecutive source code versions and were able to detect 12 requirements-related changes out of 14 with a precision of 79%. Then we traced a set of keywords we extracted from these changes to the requirements specification. In comparison to simply tracing changed classes to requirements, we got better results in most cases."

The physical environment of the workspace plays a significant role in effective communication, collaboration, and coordination among people while developing software. Objective In this paper, we have studied and further evaluated empirically the effect of different constituents of physical environment on communication, coordination, and collaboration, respectively. The study aims to provide a guideline for prospective agile software developers. Method A survey was conducted among software developers at a software development organization. To collect data, a survey was carried out along with observations, and interviews. Results It has been found that half cubicles are â€˜very effectiveâ€™ for the frequency of communication. Further, half cubicles were discovered â€˜effectiveâ€™ but not â€˜very effectiveâ€™ for the quality/effectiveness of communication. It is found that half-height cubicles and status boards are â€˜very effectiveâ€™ for the coordination among team members according to the survey. Communal/discussion space is found to be â€˜effectiveâ€™ but not â€˜very effectiveâ€™ for coordination among team members. Our analysis also reveals that half-height glass barriers are â€˜very effectiveâ€™ during the individuals problem-solving activities while working together as a team. Infact, such a physically open environment appears to improve communication, coordination, and collaboration. Conclusion According to this study, an open working environment with only half-height glass barriers and communal space plays a major role in communication among team members. The presence of status boards significantly help in reducing unnecessary communication by providing the required information to individuals and therefore, in turn reduce distractions a team member may confront in their absence. As communication plays a significant role in improving coordination and collaboration, it is not surprising to find the effect of open working environment and status boards in improving coordination and collaboration. An open working environment increases the awareness among software developers e.g. who is doing what, what is on the agenda, what is taking place, etc. That in turn, improves coordination among them. A communal/discussion space helps in collaboration immensely."

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a key agile practice and recent research results suggest that the successful adoption of TDD depends on different limiting factors, one of them being insufficient developer testing skills. The goal of this paper is to investigate if developers who are educated on general testing knowledge will be able to utilize TDD more effectively. We conducted a controlled experiment with master students during the course on Software Verification & Validation (V&V) where source code and test cases created by each participant during the labs as well as their answers on a survey questionnaire were collected and analyzed. Descriptive statistics indicate improvements in statement coverage. However, no statistically significant differences could be established between the pre- and post-course groups of students. By qualitative analysis of students' tests, we noticed a lack of test cases for non-stated requirements (""negative""tests) resulting in a non-detection of bugs. Students did show preference towards TDD in surveys. Although further research is required to fully establish this, we believe that identifying specific testing knowledge which is complementary to the testing skills of a new TDD developer would enable developers to perform their tasks in a more efficient manner.

Test-driven development attracts attention as well as followers in professional environment; however empirical evidence of its superiority regarding its effect on productivity, code and tests compared to test-last development is still fairly limited. Moreover, it is not clear if the supposed benefits come from writing tests before code or maybe from high iterativity/short development cycles. Objective This paper describes a family of controlled experiments comparing test-driven development to micro iterative test-last development with emphasis on productivity, code properties (external quality and complexity) and tests (code coverage and fault-finding capabilities). Method Subjects were randomly assigned to test-driven and test-last groups. Controlled experiments were conducted for two years, in an academic environment and in different developer contexts (pair programming and individual programming contexts). Number of successfully implemented stories, percentage of successful acceptance tests, McCabeâ€™s code complexity, code coverage and mutation score indicator were measured. Results Experimental results and their selective meta-analysis show no statistically significant differences between test-driven development and iterative test-last development regarding productivity (Ï‡2(6)&#xa0;=&#xa0;4.799, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;1.0, r&#xa0;=&#xa0;.107, 95% \{CI\} (confidence interval): âˆ’.149 to .349), code complexity (Ï‡2(6)&#xa0;=&#xa0;8.094, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.46, r&#xa0;=&#xa0;.048, 95% CI: âˆ’.254 to .341), branch coverage (Ï‡2(6)&#xa0;=&#xa0;13.996, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.059, r&#xa0;=&#xa0;.182, 95% CI: âˆ’.081 to .421), percentage of acceptance tests passed (one experiment, Mannâ€“Whitney U&#xa0;=&#xa0;125.0, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.98, r&#xa0;=&#xa0;.066) and mutation score indicator (Ï‡2(4)&#xa0;=&#xa0;3.807, p&#xa0;=&#xa0;.87, r&#xa0;=&#xa0;.128, 95% CI: âˆ’.162 to .398).

1418.0,Excluded,ec3,Implementation and design of a service-based framework to integrate personal and institutional learning environments,"Abstract The landscape of teaching and learning has changed in recent years because of the application of Information and Communications technology. Among the most representative innovations in this regard are Learning Management Systems. Despite of their popularity in institutional contexts and the wide set of tools and services that they provide to learners and teachers, they present several issues. Learning Management Systems are linked to an institution and a period of time, and are not adapted to learnersÊ¼ needs. In order to address these problems Personal Learning Environments are defined, but it is clear that these will not replace Learning Management Systems and other institutional contexts. Both types of environment should therefore coexist and interact. This paper presents a service-based framework to facilitate such interoperability. It supports the export of functionalities from the institutional to the personal environment and also the integration within the institution of learning outcomes from personal activities. In order to achieve this in a flexible, extensible and open way, web services and interoperability specifications are used. In addition some interoperability scenarios are posed. The framework has been tested in real learning contexts and the results show that interoperability is possible, and that it benefits learners, teachers and institutions."

An \{ERP\} system is a cross-functional system which integrates various units in the company with an attempt to shorten processing time, increase responsiveness, and achieve competitive advantages. Among all the modules popularly included in an \{ERP\} system, there is a critical one called the order-to-cash (OTC) module. In this paper, Levi Strauss &amp; Co. in China-Hong Kong (LSCO-CHK) is selected as the target case company. Via semi-structured interviews and discussions with some staff members of the company, we examine the implementation of \{OTC\} module in LSCO-CHK's \{ERP\} system. The benefits and the problems encountered during the system development process are examined. Based on the case study results, and the extensive literature review, we conclude that whether implementing fashion \{ERP\} systems in China can successfully enhance production and operations management relies on many measures which include (i) understanding the â€œhuman mindsetâ€� of Chinese society, (ii) showing full respect to the staff members during the implementation process, (iii) emphasizing the importance of guanxi with both internal staff members and external business partners, (iv) providing attractive tangible and intangible incentives to participants. We argue that if the above measures are well-taken, implementing technological information systems solutions in China can be more successful than the ones in the western countries because of the Chinese cultural merit which treasures â€œcooperationâ€� when Chinese people feel respected. Finally, future challenges and research opportunities on implementing fashion \{ERP\} systems in China are explored."

This causes significant variance and uncertainty in software project planning as human labor is very hard to predict. This article represents a new approach to resource allocation in software development projects that will be demonstrated using software development methodology called ""Agile."" The reason we selected this methodology is because ""Agile"" is already considered to be the most effective way of project management in software [1]; therefore, if we can enhance resource allocation efficiently in Agile projects then it could be done in all software projects where Agile is applicable, Agile software development has evolved in the past two decades into a set of tools for developing software. It is based on ""all at once"" models that assume that the creation of software is done by simultaneously working on requirements, analysis, design, coding, and testing, then delivering the entire system all at once. Agile main principle is using an iterative and incremental approach to building software. In Agile practice most of the responsibility is on the hands of the team members that need to estimate the work within iteration and commit to it. In order to accomplish this today, team members use their experience, educated advice, and some rules of thumb. We believe that especially in this stressed environment with almost ""microscopic"" work assignments, there should be a simple and fast mathematical model that assists them in this task. The model should handle dynamic environments and risky situations. This paper presents such a model, called HRA, and demonstrate in on a simple but representative real scenario."

Specialist knowledge inhibits self-organization and role interchangeability which are key elements of agile development. Knowing that bureaucracies are hard to counteract once established, how can development of general knowledge in software organizations be improved? Job rotation is a well-known practice often used to improve general knowledge. The reported action research evaluated job rotation among developers in customer support. The findings suggest that general knowledge is considered interesting and valuable among the participants. However, the findings also show that general knowledge acquisition can be found irrelevant and therefore counter-efficient for day-to-day work among participants if the perceived applicability to own projects is too low. Therefore, using job rotation to improve general knowledge requires careful considerations. Implications for research and practice are discussed."

As a consequence, automated tools are expected to support refactoring, both for reducing the developerÊ¼s effort as well as for avoiding errors due to manual changes. In this context, the chosen programming language has a major impact on the level of support that an automated refactoring tool can offer. One important aspect of a programming language concerning the automation of refactoring is the type system. While a static type system, present in languages such as Java, provides information about dependencies in the program, the dynamic type system of the Smalltalk programming language offers little information that can be used by automated refactoring tools. This paper focuses on the challenges in the context of refactoring raised by the dynamic type system of Smalltalk. It highlights the problems caused by the absence of static type information and proposes the use of static code analysis for performing type inference to gather information about the dependencies in the programÊ¼s source code. It explains the mechanism of the static code analysis using sample code and presents a prototype of an enhanced refactoring tool, which uses the structural information extracted through static code analysis. Empirical samples build the base for evaluating the effectiveness of the approach."

However, in the busy workday of a software project, there is rarely time for such reviews and there is a need for effective methods that will yield good results quickly without the need for external consultants or experts. Building on an existing method for retrospective analysis and theories of group involvement, we propose improvements to the root cause analysis phase of a lightweight retrospective analysis method known as post mortem analysis (PMA). In particular, to facilitate brainstorming during the root cause analysis phase of the PMA, we propose certain processual changes to facilitate more active individual participation and the use of less rigidly structured diagrams. We conducted a controlled experiment to compare this new variation of the method with the existing one, and conclude that in our setting of small software teams with no access to an experienced facilitator, the new variation is more effective when it comes to identifying possible root causes of problems and successes. The modified method also produced more specific starting points for improving the software development process."

The results can identify the categories of consumption and sectors of production that contribute most to environmental impact allowing policy makers to prioritise intervention into particular areas. However, these data are not readily accessible to policy makers and civil society, making it difficult to extract and communicate the important messages it contains. The web-based tool â€” \{EUREAPA\} â€” was created as a usable, task-oriented interface to improve access to environmental and economic data held within a complex EE-MRIO model and make it more relevant to policy makers and civil society. The project team of scientists and \{IT\} specialists used an iterative, agile and participatory approach to engage potential end-users in the specification and testing of the tool. The engagement process identified two principal functions that were essential for the \{EUREAPA\} tool: viewing data and creating scenarios. The viewing data function allows users to analyse the wealth of data held within the model and present results from a range of perspectives. This helps to understand the causes of environmental pressure and identify priorities for policy intervention. The scenario function helps to communicate how changes in consumption and production might affect the future environmental impact of citizens of the EU, and facilitates long-term planning. Through this dialogue process the project has been able to ensure \{EUREAPA\} is relevant, user-friendly and fit-for-purpose. It is intended that \{EUREAPA\} will be adopted by policy makers and civil society as an important policy planning and assessment aid in the complex field of sustainable consumption and production."
1436.0,Excluded,ec7,Improving the reliability of transaction identification in use cases,"Context The concept of transactions is used in Use Case Points (UCP), and in many other functional size measurement methods, to capture the smallest unit of functionality that should be considered while measuring the size of a system. Unfortunately, in the case of the \{UCP\} method at least four methods for use-case transaction identification have been proposed so far. The different approaches to transaction identification and difficulties related to the analysis of requirements expressed in natural language can lead to problems in the reliability of functional size measurement. Objective The goal of this study was to evaluate reliability of transaction identification in use cases (with the methods mentioned in the literature), analyze their weaknesses, and propose some means for their improvement. Method A controlled experiment on a group of 120 students was performed to investigate if the methods for transaction identification, known from the literature, provide similar results. In addition, a qualitative analysis of the experiment data was performed to investigate the potential problems related to transaction identification in use cases. During the experiment a use-case benchmark specification was used. The automatic methods for transaction identification, proposed in the paper have been validated using the same benchmark by comparing the outcomes provided by these methods to on-average number of transactions identified by the participants of the experiment. Results A significant difference in the median number of transactions was observed between groups using different methods of transaction identification. The Kruskalâ€“Wallis test was performed with the significance level Î± set to 0.05 and followed by the post-hoc analysis performed according to the procedure proposed by Conover. Also a large intra-method variability was observed. The ratios between the maximum and minimum number of transactions identified by the participants using the same method were equal to 1.96, 3.83, 2.03, and 2.21. The proposed automatic methods for transaction identification provided results consistent with those provided by the participants of the experiment and functional measurement experts. The relative error between the number of transaction identified by the tool and on-average number of transactions identified by the participants of the experiment ranged from 3% to 7%. Conclusions Human-performed transaction identification is error prone and quite subjective. Its reliability can be improved by automating the process with the use of natural language processing techniques."

1440.0,Excluded,ec7,Inclusive development: Software engineering requirements for universally accessible interactions,"The notion of â€˜universal accessâ€™ reflects the concept of an Information Society in which potentially anyone (i.e. any user) will interact with computing machines, at anytime and anyplace (i.e. in any context of use) and for virtually anything (i.e. for any task). Towards reaching a successful and cost effective realization of this vision, it is critical to ensure that the future interface development tools provide all the necessary instrumentation to support inclusive design, i.e. facilitate inclusive development. In the meantime, it is crucial that both tool developers and interface developers acquire awareness regarding the key development features they should pursue when investigating for the most appropriate software engineering support in addressing such a largely demanding development goal (i.e. universally accessible interactions). This paper discusses a corpus of key development requirements for building universally accessible interactions that has been consolidated from real practice, in the course of six medium-to-large scale research projects, all completed, within a 10 years timeframe."

1446.0,Included,included,Incorporating user centered requirement engineering into agile software development,"Agile Software Engineering approaches gain more and more popularity in today's development organizations. The need for usable products is also a growing factor for organizations. Thus, their development processes have to react on mis demand and have to offer approaches to integrate the factor ""usability"" in their development processes. The approach presented in this paper evaluates how agile software engineering models consider activities of Usability Engineering to ensure the creation of usable software products. The user-centeredness of the two agile SE models Scrum and XP has been analyzed and the question of how potential gaps can be filled without loosing the process' agility is discussed. As requirements play a decisive role during software development, in Software Engineering as well as Usability Engineering. Therefore, different User Centered Requirements that ensure the development of usable systems served as basis for the gap-analysis. Â© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007."

There are many advantages for developers willing to learn: increased internal and external quality of the produced software, and a reduced learning curve as beginners become high-skilled developers much faster than usual. However, learning is not taken seriously by many teams.

In this paper, we design and implement a scheme to increase \{GPRS\} download throughput for a vehicle user while he (she) is moving on the roads. This scheme integrates inter-vehicle communication with trunking mechanisms to achieve this goal. This scheme can be readily deployed for any real-world \{GPRS\} network or any 3G network without any support from the network operator. Our field trial results show that when this scheme is applied in a motorcade of four vehicles and all of the \{GPRS\} channel provided by each vehicle are used to download a file simultaneously, the download speed is 3.92 times faster than that achieved when only one \{GPRS\} channel is used."

This experience report will highlight these R&D leadership roles, describe flat, hierarchical, and matrix R&D organization structures, and then illustrate the influence of these organizational structures on key leaderships behaviors for an agile environment. These behaviors include leading versus managing, flexing existing team boundaries, driving both team and project success, and balancing team versus individual needs.

1486.0,Excluded,ec3,Influences on regression testing strategies in agile software development environments,"Regression testing is a well-established practice in software development, but in recent years it has seen a change of status and emphasis with the increasing popularity of agile methods, which stress the central role of regression testing in maintaining software quality. The objectives of this article are to investigate regression testing strategies in agile development teams and identify the factors that can influence the adoption and implementation of this practice. We have used a mixed methods approach to our research, beginning with an analysis of the literature to identify research themes related to the adoption of regression testing techniques under agile methodologies, from which we developed an analytical framework for the study. This was followed by three exploratory case studies that we used to exercise the main elements of the framework, develop some key themes of interest, and devise a questionnaire for the final stage of the study, an on-line survey to explore the main issues identified in the case studies across different contexts. Within our specific sample, our results suggest that organizational maturity is a key factor in effective regression testing practices and that the adoption of such practices is helped by a coherent testing philosophy and change management processes. We also found that the return on investment in automated regression testing was positive for our respondents and that adopting these practices in the context of agile methods had been a relatively painless process for the organizations in our survey. We conclude that investing in regression testing tools and processes is likely to be beneficial for organizations. However, further work is needed in assessing how organizational culture impacts on the quality process and the financial outcomes for commercial software development organizations."

To meet their need we have to perform requirement engineering which helps to identify and structure requirements. In traditional software development methods end users or stakeholders predefined their requirements and sent to the development team to analysis and negotiation to produce requirement specification. In many cases it is risky or very difficult and not economical to produce a complete, verifiable set of requirements. Traditional software development has a problem to deal with requirement change after careful analysis and negotiation. This problem is well tackled by the XP as XP recommends an on-site customer to represents their requirements through user stories on story cards. Generally customers have rarely a general picture of the requirements or system in their mind which leads problems related to requirements like requirements conflicts, missing requirements, and ambiguous requirements etc, and does not address non-functional requirements from exploration phase."

Furthermore, the marketing literature has placed increasing emphasis on the importance of understanding customers' processes and customer value. This paper presents an action research study on the roadmapping problems of two software product companies. The key findings were that customer knowledge was fragmented across different functions of the companies and that roadmapping neglected service development. To solve these problems, analysis of customer value and customers' processes was integrated into roadmapping. Facilitated workshops with cross-functional teams were used to analyze the customers' processes in their entirety and to create a holistic view to roadmapping. The lessons learned offer practical means with which software companies can shift their focus from the prioritization of software features to the analysis of customers' processes and the prioritization of customers' activities. The shift promotes value creation from the customers' perspective and the discovery of new service business opportunities."

1522.0,Excluded,ec3,Interaction Design in an Engineering-Centric World,"Publisher Summary It is hard to imagine any design training that doesn't include process as a significant part of the studio experience. Put simply, process drives repeatabilityâ€”reducing the reliance on inspirationâ€”and creates a framework in which creative professionals can execute. Developers and engineers are also familiar with the use of process as a framework in which to increase the odds of repeatable results, and most have training and experience using a variety of software development processes. However, most have little experience with the â€œunderstand, design, validate, deliverâ€� sorts of processes frequently applied in design disciplines. Their own experience using a variety of engineering processes creates common ground for the two disciplines, and creates opportunities for setting expectations between the disciplines. In the design process, it is not uncommon to have to return to previous phases. Particularly in environments where clients or executives have the vision themselves to recognize that designers are not on a path to success, it is not uncommon to return to gather broader understanding about a domain, or competitors, or influences. Chris Connors is currently employed at Apple. Prior to working at Apple, Chris worked at \{NASA\} with a focus on designing future mission support tools for planning robotic activity during surface operations on Mars.

1527.0,Excluded,ec7,Interactive requirements prioritization using a genetic algorithm,"Context The order in which requirements are implemented affects the delivery of value to the end-user, but it also depends on technical constraints and resource availability. The outcome of requirements prioritization is a total ordering of requirements that best accommodates the various kinds of constraints and priorities. During requirements prioritization, some decisions on the relative importance of requirements or the feasibility of a given implementation order must necessarily resort to a human (e.g., the requirements analyst), possessing the involved knowledge. Objective In this paper, we propose an Interactive Genetic Algorithm (IGA) that includes incremental knowledge acquisition and combines it with the existing constraints, such as dependencies and priorities. We also assess the performance of the proposed algorithm. Method The validation of \{IGA\} was conducted on a real case study, by comparing the proposed algorithm with the state of the art, interactive prioritization technique Incomplete Analytic Hierarchy Process (IAHP). Results The proposed method outperforms \{IAHP\} in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and robustness to decision maker errors. Conclusion \{IGA\} produces a good approximation of the reference requirements ranking, requiring an acceptable manual effort and tolerating a reasonable human error rate."

1530.0,Excluded,ec3,Interpretative case studies on agile team productivity and management,"Context The management of software development productivity is a key issue in software organizations, where the major drivers are lower cost and shorter time-to-market. Agile methods, including Extreme Programming and Scrum, have evolved as â€œlightâ€� approaches that simplify the software development process, potentially leading to increased team productivity. However, little empirical research has examined which factors do have an impact on productivity and in what way, when using agile methods. Objective Our objective is to provide a better understanding of the factors and mediators that impact agile team productivity. Method We have conducted a multiple-case study for 6&#xa0;months in three large Brazilian companies that have been using agile methods for over 2&#xa0;years. We have focused on the main productivity factors perceived by team members through interviews, documentation from retrospectives, and non-participant observation. Results We developed a novel conceptual framework, using thematic analysis to understand the possible mechanisms behind such productivity factors. Agile team management was found to be the most influential factor in achieving agile team productivity. At the intra-team level, the main productivity factors were team design (structure and work allocation) and member turnover. At the inter-team level, the main productivity factors were how well teams could be effectively coordinated by proper interfaces and other dependencies and avoiding delays in providing promised software to dependent teams. Conclusion Teams should be aware of the influence and magnitude of turnover, which has been shown negative for agile team productivity. Team design choices remain an important factor impacting team productivity, even more pronounced on agile teams that rely on teamwork and people factors. The intra-team coordination processes must be adjusted to enable productive work by considering priorities and pace between teams.

1533.0,Excluded,ec3,Introducing knowledge redundancy practice in software development: Experiences with job rotation in support work,"Context Job rotation is a widely known approach to increase knowledge redundancy but empirical evidence regarding introduction and adoption in software development is scant. A lack of knowledge redundancy is a limiting factor for collaboration, flexibility, and coordination within teams and within the organization. Objective The scientific objective of this investigation was to explore benefits and challenges with improving knowledge redundancy among developers participating in job rotation. There were two practical objectives; (a) to establish customer support as a legitimate organizational function that would shield developers from support enquiries, and (b) to contribute to improved flexibility in project staffing by enabling overlapping product experience among developers. Method We used action research to integrate organizational change with scientific inquiry. During a period of eighteen weeks, nine developers rotated to customer support. We collected data throughout the period of collaboration; in meetings, from comprehensive interviews, and from customer support work logs. Results Perceptions of reduced efficiency and unnecessary redundancy outweighed benefits of shielding and learning about different products. Although there were strong indications of increased knowledge redundancy, the benefits were not sufficient to justify job rotation. Job rotation was abandoned after the trial period. Conclusions Job rotation can contribute to improved knowledge redundancy. Benefits of knowledge redundancy include innovation stemming from integration of different knowledge domains and improved appreciation of organizational concerns. However, knowledge redundancy incurs a collective cost that must be amortized and legitimized by the organization. An adoption process that accommodates open and trustful discussion among all involved stakeholders is therefore encouraged."

Such integration can be achieved by replacing the disconnected and incompatible legacy applications by enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Along with the remarkable growth of the \{ERP\} market, we have seen a number of failure cases of \{ERP\} adoption. Such failure cases indicate that not all firms know how to adopt an \{ERP\} solution effectively. Objective To explore and identify crucial practices from real experiences in the Asiaâ€“Pacific region that may explain a firmâ€™s success in \{ERP\} procurement, with an overt intention toward the formulation of useful lessons that inform practitioners and contribution to advances in software development practices in organizations. Method A multiple-case design involving three Chinese firms based in Hong Kong and a local firm in Australia was employed. We collected, verified, and analyzed the information about the \{ERP\} procurement practice in each subject firm by means of semi-structured interviews, archive reviews, and member checks. Results We summarized our results in the form of 10 lessons learned, together with observations of how culture seems to have played a part in shaping the practice. Conclusion Our results offer practical guidelines originated from real cases that are of use for practitioners to improve the \{ERP\} procurement process."

For this study, we have applied grounded theory as a suitable qualitative approach to determine what is happening in actual practice. The data was collected by semi-structured interviews with professionals who have already worked with an integrated agile UCD methodology. Further data was collected by observing these professionals in their working context, and by studying their documents, where possible. The emerging themes that the study found show that there is an increasing realization of the importance of usability in software development among agile team members. The requirements are emerging; and both low and high fidelity prototypes based usability tests are highly used in agile teams. There is an appreciation of each other's work from both UCD professionals and developers and both sides can learn from each other. Â© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009."

This special issue focuses on â€œInterplay between User Experience Evaluation and Software Developmentâ€�, stating that the gap between human-computer interaction and software engineering with regard to usability has somewhat been narrowed. Unfortunately, our experience shows that software development organizations perform few usability engineering activities or none at all. Several authors acknowledge that, in order to understand the reasons of the limited impact of usability engineering and \{UX\} methods, and to try to modify this situation, it is fundamental to thoroughly analyze current software development practices, involving practitioners and possibly working from inside the companies. This article contributes to this research line by reporting an experimental study conducted with software companies. The study has confirmed that still too many companies either neglect usability and UX, or do not properly consider them. Interesting problems emerged. This article gives suggestions on how they may be properly addressed, since their solution is the starting point for reducing the gap between research and practice of usability and UX. It also provides further evidence on the value of the research method, called Cooperative Method Development, based on the collaboration of researchers and practitioners in carrying out empirical research; it has been used in a step of the performed study and has revealed to be instrumental for showing practitioners why to improve their development processes and how to do so."

One common type of meeting in software projects is the daily team meeting, which is the most important forum for coordinating and planning daily work. To better understand how software teams make decisions, communicate, and coordinate their work, we must uncover the micro-level interaction processes among the team members at these meetings. We analyzed transcriptions of eight daily meetings from two software development teams. The agile literature states that the daily meeting should focus on answering questions such as ""What have I done? What will be done? What obstacles are in my way?"" However, on average, only 24% of each of the meetings that we studied focused on this task. We found that 35% of the meeting was spent on elaborating problem issues and discussing possible solutions. Very little time was used for coordinating tasks. Our results indicate that many project decisions are made in daily team meetings and that this quick decision making requires team members to be experts. These experts need to have a shared understanding of who is responsible for what and of the information and requirements needed to solve the tasks."

1546.0,Excluded,ec3,Investigating the capability of agile processes to support life-science regulations: The case of XP and FDA regulations with a focus on human factor requirements,"Recently, there has been a noticeable increase of attention to regulatory compliance. As a result, more and more organizations are required to comply with the laws and regulations that apply to their industry sector. An important aspect of these regulations is directly related to the way by which software systems, used by regulated companies, are built, tested, and maintained. While some of these regulations require from these systems to support a very specific set of requirements, others, the focus of this paper, are concerned with the process by which the system has been built. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, for example, impose stringent requirements on the process by which software systems used in medical devices are developed. One particular focus of the FDA regulations is on having a user-centered approach for building software for medical devices through the use of well-known concepts in the area of human factor engineering. In this paper, we discuss these requirements in detail and show how Extreme Programming, an agile process, lacks the necessary practices to support them. We also propose an extension to XP, that if adopted, we believe it will address this particular need of the FDA regulations for medical device software. Â© 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

Based on a generic XP system including feedback influences and using a cause-effect model including social-technical affecting factors, as our research tool, the study statistically evaluates the application of XP practices in the software companies being studied. Data were collected from 30 managers and developers, using the sample survey technique with questionnaires and interviews, in a time period of six months. Practices were analysed individually, using Descriptive Statistics (DS), and as a whole by building up different models using stepwise Discriminant Analysis (DA). The results have shown that companies, facing various problems with common code ownership, on-site customer, 40-hour week and metaphor, prefer to develop their own tailored XP method and way of working-practices that met their requirements. Pair programming and test-driven development were found to be the most significant success factors. Interactions and hidden dependencies for the majority of the practices as well as communication and synergy between skilled personnel were found to be other significant success factors. The contribution of this preliminary research work is to provide some evidence that may assist companies in evaluating whether the XP system as a holistic framework would suit their current situation.

We also found that the primary strategies for avoiding testing schedule over-runs were reducing the scope of testing, leaving out features from the software, and allocating more resources to testing."

1553.0,Excluded,ec3,Is Scrum and \{XP\} suitable for \{CSE\} Development?,"This article discusses the question if Scrum and \{XP\} is well suited for development of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) software. The reason for choosing Scrum and \{XP\} is based on two facts. Firstly, \{CSE\} developers are not used to formal processes for software development and Scrum and \{XP\} are informal in nature, hence easier to adopt. Secondly \{CSE\} projects are often once-off and aimed at producing scientific results rather than commercial software, so the overhead of a process or methodology needs to be kept at a minimum. Scrum and \{XP\} are focused on producing software, thus keeping everything else, i.e. the overhead to a minimum, a fact that benefits \{CSE\} development. In this article, the characteristics of Scrum and \{XP\} in particular and agile development in general are evaluated against the needs of \{CSE\} developers. The results show that almost all the key points in both methodologies are well suited for \{CSE\} development and that agile development in general is a good match with CSE."

For this it is required that the students are familiar with the major development process, ideally on the example of a concrete student project. During a one-semester software development seminar the students were grouped into 7 groups with 4-5 students each and each group was assigned eXtreme Programming, SCRUM or Open Unified Process as development process. Each student was asked to keep a development diary and answer questionnaires during and at the end of the project. Each group was asked to document the changes to their development process, identified development problems, employed mitigation strategies and the project progress in form of a retrospective report. Analysis of the reports revealed common issues and mitigation strategies, which can be classified into the following: meeting organization; communication; project roles, requirements engineering, continuous tests and process adherence. The employed mitigation strategies were classified into the same categories; quantified and evaluated regarding their respective effectiveness."

1562.0,Excluded,ec3,iUCP - Estimating interaction design projects with enhanced use case Points,"This paper describes an approach to adapt the use-case point estimation method to fit the requirements of agile development of interactive software. Creating product cost estimates early in the development lifecycle is a challenge for the software industry, they require substantial data from past projects and constant feedback and fine-tuning, which are rarely available or consistent through interactive software development. In addition, the profusion of incremental and evolutionary development methods (like Scrum and XP) produced new challenges with estimating frequent releases. Here we propose several changes to the original use-case point estimation method, in particular to take advantage of the enhanced information that can be extracted from usage-centered design (usageCD) that devotes particular attention to critical aspects like weighting actors and uses-cases for complexity. We propose to exploit user-roles, essential use-cases and the usageCD architecture to enhance the weighting heuristics for assigning complexity factors to actors and use-cases required to calculate the unadjusted use-case point reflecting the complexity of the requirements for a given iteration or evolution. We propose to exploit user-roles as the main basis for weighting complex actors, which originally are grouped in the highest weight factor. Conversely we propose to extract the complexity of use-cases from essential use case steps depicted through user intentions and system responsibilities and also the analysis classes extract from those for the usageCD architecture. Detailing this approach the paper presents a contribution, not only to leverage more accurate early lifecycle software estimation, but also to bridge the gap between SE and HCI enabling cross-fertilization between the two disciplines.

The amount of work carried out by the Information Technology (IT) tools varies from 60% to 100% depending on the design phase and the shipyard. Decision support provides the designer with methods to find optimal solutions, as the charge of an innovative structure of previous projects is limited. New techniques as virtual reality are now available in the ship design offices. Ship design is a typical collaborative work leading to concurrent engineering. \{IT\} is widely used not only within the shipyard, but also with sub-contracting companies and suppliers. The various partners involved in the design tools developmentâ€”shipyards, software vendors, classification societies, and research centersâ€”have clearly identified that the real challenge for the future is still dealing with data exchange. A ship remains a very complex product with many systems and a large and complicated arrangement.

1577.0,Excluded,ec3,Knowledge kanban system for virtual research and development,"Virtual research and development (R&amp;D) is inevitable to reduce the product life cycle. Enterprises tend to rely on their foreign partners for supporting technology and knowledge acquisition to conduct and improve firmsâ€™ product development with low R&amp;D risk. R&amp;D is a highly creative and knowledge-intensive activity, Therefore, efficient knowledge flow, which transmits the right knowledge to the right people at the right time, is key to improving efficiency of the R&amp;D process. Kanban supports visual production control using the card of providing information to regulate the flow of inventory and materials. To enhance the knowledge flow efficiency in the virtual R&amp;D process, this study proposes a knowledge kanban system utilizing the philosophy of kanban management and knowledge engineering techniques. Employees can quickly, easily, and exactly determine what knowledge they need to learn, create, share, and maintain by the knowledge kanban system. This system assists employees to do the right thing, to reduce the cycle time of R&amp;D processes, and to enhance the reuse of knowledge, to create new knowledge. To achieve this objective, this study first proposes a knowledge flow model in virtual R&amp;D based on the analysis result of knowledge in virtual enterprises (VEs), and then designs the knowledge kanban model according to the knowledge flow model in virtual R&amp;D and proposes the knowledge kanban functional framework based on the knowledge kanban model. Finally, this study develops the related technologies to implement the knowledge kanban system. The knowledge kanban system is an effective tool to facilitate knowledge creation, storage, transmission and sharing for R&amp;D engineers to develop knowledge in problem solving and product development, to improve enterprise competitiveness."

1581.0,Excluded,ec3,Knowledge-oriented software engineering process in a multi-cultural context,"In software engineering, leading trends can be detected that will affect the characteristic features of a product and its development process. On a product level, the growth of size and complexity is apparent—but on the one hand only. On the other hand, there is also a growing demand for simple and reasonable small software products executed by handheld terminals and smartphones; these applications are in many cases expected to collaborate with databases over the Internet. In addition, different kinds of service concepts (ASP, SaaS) are becoming recognized alternatives to the traditional way of buying software. Increasingly, software products are also distributed in a wide geographical scope to users with different cultural backgrounds and expectations. In software engineering work, as a consequence of this growth in size and complexity, the development work is more and more often distributed. The software business itself is becoming global because of acquisitions, offshoring, and international subcontracting. The globalization of work sets new requirements to the engineering processes: in international teams the organisational and cultural differences of the development subteams have to be recognized. In this paper, the focus is on the software development and its global dimension—especially the roles of multi-cultural and cross-organizational issues in software engineering. Our paper presents the results of the first phase of our three phases research project related to “Culture-Aware Software Engineering.” The main result of the first phase is the multi-cultural software engineering working model introduced in our paper. Culture is seen as one example of the context, i.e. the situation at hand. The concept of culture has also different meanings, which have to be understood in well-organized software engineering. Software engineering work is analyzed as a knowledge creation process, in which both explicit and tacit knowledge are recognized and the transformation between these establishes baselines along the development life cycle."

In 2005, we estimate that human land use modifies 8% of the total land cover in the Colorado \{SRE\} and that 13% of the study area was functionally modified. Agriculture had the greatest impact in terms of area of modified land cover (282,305&#xa0;ha). Residential (exurban) land use had a smaller footprint (HMc) but the close proximity to public lands, dispersed spatial pattern (high HMfd), and rapid increase in rural and exurban housing density observed in the \{SRE\} have important implications. This research demonstrates how fine scale land cover data can be used to examine land use pattern and composition as well as track land use change."

Many of the optimizations described in this paper are the result of using A3 problem solving. What makes the Systematic experience unique, is the larger focus of the problem solving effort, at an organizational level, in which individual projects are used as experiments to try out countermeasures to address root causes. This is possible because Systematic, based on a CMMI focus, already employs a level of standard work across project and product engagements so that we can apply learning from an experiment on one project to future projects. Experience from the past five years has resulted in significant improvements to our processes including our Scrum implementation, and has revealed insight into five key measures to monitor projects. The experiences also show important lessons learned on how to combine team retrospective learning with organizational learning."

In this paper, we describe some of the challenges of software product development and how the challenges are being met by lean management principles and techniques. Specifically, we examine lean principles and techniques that were devised by Toyota and other manufacturers over the last 50 years. Applying lean principles to software development projects has been advocated for over ten years and it will be shown that the extensive lean literature is a valuable source of ideas for software development. A case study with a software development organisation, Timberline Inc., will demonstrate that lean principles and techniques can be successfully applied to software product development.

Then, combining a detailed case study and empirical analysis, we find that lean software projects perform better than non-lean software projects at the company for most performance outcomes. We document the influence of the lean initiative on internal processes and examine how the techniques affect learning by improving both problem identification and problem resolution.

This is the essence of test driven development, an agile practice built upon sound software engineering principles. When applied effectively, this practice can have many benefits. The question becomes how to effectively adopt test driven development. This paper describes the experiences and lessons learned by two teams who adopted test driven development methodology for software systems developed at TransCanada. The overall success of test driven methodology is contingent upon the following key factors: experienced team champion, well-defined test scope, supportive database environment, repeatable software design pattern, and complementary manual testing. All of these factors and the appropriate test regime will lead to a better chance of success in a test driven development project."

The challenge lies in the difficulty of analyzing and assessing the proneness to requirement changes across multiple versions, especially when the scale of requirements is large. In this paper, we define a series of metrics to characterize historic evolution information, and propose a novel method for predicting requirements that are likely to evolve in the future based on the metrics. We apply the prediction method to analyze the product updates history through a case study. The empirical results show that this method can provide a tradeoff solution that narrows down the scope of change analysis to a small set of requirements, but it still can retrieve nearly half of the future changes. The results indicate that the defined metrics are sensitive to the history of requirements evolution, and the prediction method can reach a valuable outcome for requirement engineers to balance their workload and risks."

In this article we show that Agile methodologies can be applied in a CMM context, specifying how every goal of each Key Process Area of the model can be fulfilled when an Agile methodology such as Xp@Scrum is being used. We also show some metrics from pilote projects at a Motorola Software Centre backing our aiming, and showing the benefits introduced by Agile approaches to software development."

To simplify model construction a framework is required that relieves the model developer from software engineering concerns. In addition, as the demand for a holistic understanding of environmental systems increases, access to external model components is necessary in order to construct integrated models. We present a modelling framework that provides two- and three-dimensional building blocks for construction of spatio-temporal models. Two different modelling languages available in the framework, the first tailored and the second an enhanced Python scripting language, allow the development and modification of models. We explain for both languages the interfaces allowing to link specialised model components and thus extending the functionality of the framework. We demonstrate the coupling of external components in order to create multicomponent models by the development of the link to the groundwater model \{MODFLOW\} and provide results of an integrated catchment model. The approach described is appropriate for constructing integrated models that include a coupling of a small number of components."
1612.0,Excluded,ec7,Linking Functional Requirements and Software Verification,"Synchronization between component requirements and implementation centric tests remains a challenge that is usually addressed by requirements reviews with testers and traceability policies. The claim of this work is that linking requirements, their scenario-based formalizations, and software verification provides a promising extension to this approach. Formalized scenarios, for example in the form of low-level assume/assert statements in C, are easier to trace to requirements than traditional test sets. For a verification engineer, they offer an opportunity to better participate in requirements changes. Changes in requirements can be more easily propagated because adapting formalized scenarios is often easier than deriving and updating a large set of test cases. The proposed idea is evaluated in a case study encompassing over 50 functional requirements of an automotive software developed at Robert Bosch GmbH. Results indicate that requirement formalization together with formal verification leads to the discovery of implementation problems missed in a traditional testing process."

These, in turn, are affected by the basic views and attitudes of the individual engineers. Objective: The objective of this paper is to establish if these views and attitudes can be linked to the personalities of software engineers. Methods: We summarize the literature on personality and software engineering and then describe an empirical study on 47 professional engineers in ten different Swedish software development companies. The study evaluated the personalities of these engineers via the \{IPIP\} 50-item five-factor personality test and prompted them on their attitudes towards and basic views on their professional activities. Results: We present extensive statistical analyses of their responses to show that there are multiple, significant associations between personality factors and software engineering attitudes. The tested individuals are more homogeneous in personality than a larger sample of individuals from the general population. Conclusion: Taken together, the methodology and personality test we propose and the associated statistical analyses can help find and quantify relations between complex factors in software engineering projects in both research and practice."

1619.0,Excluded,ec3,Locking the door but leaving the computer vulnerable: Factors inhibiting home users' adoption of software firewalls,"In the new era of a ubiquitously networked world, security measures are only as good as their weakest link. Home computers with access to the Internet are one of the weaker links as they are typically not as well protected as computers in the corporate world. Malicious actors can not only target such computers but also use them to launch attacks against other systems connected to the Internet, thus posing severe threats to data and infrastructure as well as disrupting electronic commerce. This paper investigates the factors that affect the use of security protection strategies by home computer users in relation to a specific, but crucial security technology for home â€“ a software firewall. This paper proposes individuals' concern for privacy, awareness of common security measures, attitude towards security and privacy protection technologies, and computer anxiety as important antecedents that have an impact on the users' decision to adopt a software firewall. The results of our study suggest that attitude plays a more important role than perceived usefulness in shaping users' intention to use firewalls. We attribute this interesting finding to the non-functional nature of firewall systems that work best in the background with a complex relationship to users' productivity. Hence, the results add to our current understanding of Technology Acceptance Model vis-Ã -vis technologies that serve non-functional needs such as security. We then present a set of guidelines to home computer users, Internet Service Providers, e-commerce companies, and the government to increase home users' adoption rate of privacy and security protection technologies."

SRDs contain instances of logical structures, such as use case, business rule, and functional requirement. Automated recognition and extraction of these instances enables advanced requirements management features, such as automated traceability, template conformance checking, guided editing, and interoperability with requirements management tools such as RequisitePro. The variability in content and physical representation of these instances poses challenges to their accurate recognition and extraction. To address these challenges, we present a framework allowing 1) the specification of logical structures in terms of their content, textual rendering, and variability and 2) the extraction of instances of such structures from rich-text documents. Our evaluation involves 36 different logical structures identified in 43 SRDs and shows that the intended content, style, and variability of these structures can be specified in the framework such that their instances can be extracted from the documents with high precision and recall, both close to 100%."

This paper identifies understandability of design notations as an important aspect which calls for an experimental comparison. We compare the success of university students in interpreting business process descriptions, for an established graphical notation (BPMN) and for an alternative textual notation (based on written use-cases). Because a design must be read by diverse communities, including technically trained professionals such as developers and business analysts, as well as end-users and stakeholders from a wider business setting, we used different types of participants in our experiment. Specifically, we included those who had formal training in process description, and others who had not. Our experiments showed significant increases by both groups in their understanding of the process from reading the textual model. This was not so for the graphical model, where only the trained readers showed significant increases. This finding points at the value of educating readers of graphical descriptions in that particular notation when they become exposed to such models in their daily work."

Objective This case study provides a comprehensive taxonomy of the challenges faced when a medium-scale organization decided to adopt software platforms. The study also reveals how new trends in software engineering (i.e. agile methods, distributed development, and flat management structures) interplayed with the chosen platform strategy. Method We used an ethnographic approach to collect data by spending time at a medium-scale company in Scandinavia. We conducted 16&#xa0;in-depth interviews with representatives of eight different teams, three of which were working on three separate platforms. The collected data was analyzed using Grounded Theory. Results The findings identify four classes of challenges, namely: business challenges, organizational challenges, technical challenges, and people challenges.

The purpose of this paper is to analyse the dynamics related to project flexibility, both from a theoretical and an empirical perspective. To ensure the efficiency of the project organisations, flexibility is usually not desired in the late phases of projects. The projects in this study often applied flexibility even during these phases, usually based on initiatives from project owners or users. It is paradoxical that while flexibility was frequently needed in the studied projects, it was rarely prepared for. As a consequence, structured approaches to project flexibility management are called for. The study indicates that the opinion on project flexibility held by the involved stakeholders can to a large extent be explained by their incentives related to the projects. The empirical results in this paper are based on a multi-case study covering 18 projects."

We start the course with two weeks of controlled lab exercises designed to teach the students about test driven development in JUnit/Eclipse and designing for testability (with the humble dialog box design pattern) while practicing pair programming. The rest of our semester is spent in three four-week iterations developing a product for a customer. Our teams are generally large (14-16 students) so that the projects can be large enough to motivate the use of configuration management and defect tracking tools. The requirement of pair programming limits the amount of project work the students can do outside of class, so class time is spent on the projects and teaching is on-demand individual mentoring with lectures/labs inserted as necessary. One significant challenge in managing this course is tracking individual responsibilities and activities to ensure that all of the students are fully engaged in the project. To accomplish this, we have modified the story and task cards from XP to provide feedback to the students and track individual performance against goals as part of the students' grades. The resulting course has been well received by the students. This paper will describe this course in more detail and assess its effect on students' software engineering background through students' feedback and code metrics. Â© 2005 IEEE."

Using FitLibrary eases storytest-driven development, which brings together requirements and automated testing ideas and practices to support agile software development. Storytest-driven development helps bridge the gap between what organizations really need from a system and the system that developers actually deliver. This bridge builds on several factors. Storytest-driven development builds on and reuses ideas from previous requirements approaches, turning some of them ""inside out."" Storytests don't express class diagrams and use cases directly, for example, but they're likely to emerge; making such connections explicit is a fruitful area of future work. Another promising research area is to bring a stronger task-oriented (usability) perspective to storytests."

Requirements engineers that develop software for regulated domains, such as healthcare or finance, must adapt their software as laws change to maintain legal compliance. In the United States, regulatory agencies will almost always release a proposed regulation, or rule, and accept comments from the public. The agency then considers these comments when drafting a final rule that will be binding on the regulated domain. Herein, we examine how these proposed rules evolve into final rules, and propose an Adaptability Framework. This framework can aid software engineers in predicting what areas of a proposed rule are most likely to evolve, allowing engineers to begin building towards the more stable sections of the rule.

However, collecting such data requires a large effort and this activity produces benefits only in the long term. For these reasons, companies have to use automated tools able to collect data without affecting both the productivity and the process. This approach is useful to reduce the effort related to the metrics collection but managing the different tools required for a comprehensive acquisition is not an easy task and it requires a considerable effort. This paper presents some tools and techniques for managing large metrics collection projects based on the usage of the \{PROM\} metrics collection tool."
1645.0,Excluded,ec7,Managing Requirements Uncertainty with Partial Models,"Models are good at expressing information that is known but do not typically have support for representing what information a modeler does not know at a particular phase in the software development process. Partial models address this by being able to precisely represent uncertainty about model content. In previous work, we developed a general approach for defining partial models and using them to reason about design models containing uncertainty. In this paper, we show how to apply our approach to managing uncertainty in requirements by providing support for uncertainty capture, elaboration, and change. In particular, we address the problem of specifying uncertainty within a requirements model, refining a model as uncertainty reduces, providing meaning to traceability relations between models containing uncertainty, and propagating uncertainty-reducing changes between related models. We describe the implementation of uncertainty management within the Model Management Tool Framework and illustrate our approach using two examples."

Proponents of agile processes/methods (such as extreme programming) suggest that these ""lightweight"" approaches are extremely effective. I would agree that there are many powerful aspects within these approaches. I suggest, however, that by taking an objective-based business requirements approach to project management, software projects have a high probability of running on time, and remaining in scope and within budget. Addressing requirement challenges, independent of adopting a full process, can offer many of the benefits of full process adoption while avoiding most of the expense and human issues involved with full process rollout. A business-based requirements approach is an easy-to-adopt, risk-free entry point that offers tangible quality improvements. This approach suits any project scope. Whether building a complex system for enterprise resource planning or customer relationship management, or developing small, single-user software programs, defining business requirements improves any system delivery."

The emerging Internet society is addressing new enterprise control and management integration (ECMI) challenges for agile business to manufacturing (B2M) purposes which enlarge the traditional setting of Automation Engineering to the systems engineering (SE) approach. In order to cope with the increasing complexity of integrating intelligence/information-intensive manufacturing automation within the networked manufacturing enterprise, Automation Engineering should be integrated into the systems engineering approach to achieve a holistic approach that treats in fine the technical operational manufacturing system emerging from the deployment of an ad hoc combination of formal and informal partial models.

1654.0,Excluded,ec7,Map algebra and model algebra for integrated model building,"Abstract Computer models are important tools for the assessment of environmental systems. A seamless workflow of construction and coupling of model components is essential for environmental scientists. However, currently available software packages are often tailored either to the construction of model components, or to the coupling of existing components. Combining both objectives is not straightforward, because it requires merging concepts for model component building and model component coupling. Also, software packages should be usable for domain experts such as hydrologists or ecologists who do not necessarily have expert knowledge in programming. We propose an integrated modelling framework that provides descriptive means to specify (1) model components with conventional map algebra, and (2) interactions between model components with model algebra. A prototype implementation in a high-level scripting language supports the building of integrated spatio-temporal models. For a seamless coupling of model components with different temporal and spatial discretisation, we introduce the use of accumulators. These handle the temporal aggregation of model component outputs. The framework provides templates for the custom construction of model components and accumulators, and a management layer arranges the schedule for the execution of the integrated model. We use the prototype implementation of the framework in an illustrative case study to build an integrated model that couples model components simulating the interaction between biomass growth, wildfire, and human impacts with different temporal discretisations. The high-level Python language is used as model building environment to allow domain experts without in-depth knowledge of software development practices to conduct exploratory model construction and analysis."

1659.0,Excluded,ec3,Measuring and predicting software productivity: A systematic map and review,"Context Software productivity measurement is essential in order to control and improve the performance of software development. For example, by identifying role models (e.g. projects, individuals, tasks) when comparing productivity data. The prediction is of relevance to determine whether corrective actions are needed, and to discover which alternative improvement action would yield the best results. Objective In this study we identify studies for software productivity prediction and measurement. Based on the identified studies we first create a classification scheme and map the studies into the scheme (systematic map). Thereafter, a detailed analysis and synthesis of the studies is conducted. Method As a research method for systematically identifying and aggregating the evidence of productivity measurement and prediction approaches systematic mapping and systematic review have been used. Results In total 38 studies have been identified, resulting in a classification scheme for empirical research on software productivity. The mapping allowed to identify the rigor of the evidence with respect to the different productivity approaches. In the detailed analysis the results were tabulated and synthesized to provide recommendations to practitioners. Conclusion Risks with simple ratio-based measurement approaches were shown. In response to the problems data envelopment analysis seems to be a strong approach to capture multivariate productivity measures, and allows to identify reference projects to which inefficient projects should be compared. Regarding simulation no general prediction model can be identified. Simulation and statistical process control are promising methods for software productivity prediction. Overall, further evidence is needed to make stronger claims and recommendations. In particular, the discussion of validity threats should become standard, and models need to be compared with each other."

1661.0,Excluded,ec3,Mechanism for on demand Tag-Based software testing in virtualized environments,"Software development life cycle consists of various stages like requirements, design, implementation, testing and maintenance. In a typical enterprise level project number of testcases to be executed for each release would be in thousands. One known way of segregating the testcases is using component or module names and one can also classify them based on level of importance like unit testing, functional, sanity etc. With iterative development models like Agile, the release cycle is short and it is prudent to execute the testcase selectively majorly concentrating on impacting components. In this paper we provide a generic way to manage the tests and provide an efficient mechanism to run the tests selectively. In our approach we make use of well-known build management tool called Jenkins for running the tests on-demand. One unique benefit of our approach is that the input is a single comma-separated-value (CSV) file and it is very easy to add/modify existing tests. The tests are tagged using well known keywords (viz. database-layer, configuration, regression). When some particular tests need to be run, the user enters `Tag' in the job parameter and testsuite will be generated dynamically. In this paper we also describe an end-to-end test management system that supports running selective tests with help of jobs created in Jenkins environment. The proposed model of Tests execution is highly useful in high demanding environments like agile software development model, Test driven development model where feature development is many times faster than traditional water fall model. The approach suggested in this paper makes optimum use of cloud resources by distributing the jobs, so this can be utilized specially for testing under virtualized environment."

1664.0,Excluded,ec3,Mechatronics of active vision,"Machine vision suffers from fundamental difficulties in terms of algorithm complexity and methodological approaches in finding solutions to basic problems. The active vision paradigm is an effort to address these issues by enabling the seeing agent to manipulate its visual parameters in time and space so as to simplify its computational tasks and solve for the ambiguities in the process of visual perception. In this paper it is argued that if the goal of research in computational vision is considered to be that of understanding and designing seeing systems, then we need a design strategy. In our particular case, the design strategy has been influenced by anthropomorphic qualities. The empirical nature of such research also requires systems by which one can perform experiments in real-time and in interaction with the environment. This criterion has also been an important guide-line in the design of the system. The need for the manipulation of the visual parameters is a typical application of mechatronicsâ€”the interaction between the mechanics and electronicsâ€” of a complex perceptual system. By an analysis based on observations from the primate visual system, we describe the design of such a system. Details of its implementation and performance are also provided. To demonstrate that the system meets the requirements derived from our analysis, we finally describe a set of experiments with the designed robot head involving gaze control and the integration of a set of primary ocular processes."

1678.0,Excluded,ec7,[vem:xi:] - A Methodology for Process Based Requirements Engineering,"Service-oriented architectures (SOA) aim at the alignment of business and IT by having a clear business process-centric focus. In order to reach that goal, real-world business processes are captured by business process models. These models serve as the basis for the declarative configuration of a SOA using appropriate deployment artifacts - i.e., XML-based process languages. Consequently, requirements engineering for SOAs must focus on business processes and on their integration into systems using interoperable services, which is not the case for most conventional requirements engineering approaches. In this paper we present a requirements engineering approach specifically designed for the engineering of SOAs. Requirements are captured using a unified process, based on phases and iterations eventually leading to a formalized and unambiguous requirements specification. The final requirements specification can be used in succeeding development phases - i.e. for the model-driven generation of deployment artifacts for SOAs. The presented solution is called [vem: xi:] and is successfully used in the IT department of a Mobile Network Operator (MNO) in Austria. In the highly volatile world of mobile communication the presented approach enables faster application development and faster integration of solutions, thus leading to a competitive advantage over other market participants."

1680.0,Included,included,Mind-mapping: An effective technique to facilitate requirements engineering in agile software development,"Merging agile with more traditional approaches in software development is a challenging task, especially when requirements are concerned: the main temptation is to let two opposite schools of thought become rigid in their own assumptions, without trying to recognize which advantages could come from either side. Mind mapping seems to provide a suitable solution for both parties: those who develop within an agile method and those who advocate proper requirements engineering practice. In this paper, mind mapping has been discussed as a suitable technique to elicit and represent requirements within the SCRUM model: specifically, we have focused on whether and how mind maps could lead to the development of a suitable product backlog, which in SCRUM plays the role of an initial requirements specification document. In order to experimentally assess how effectively practitioners could rely on a product backlog for their first development sprint, we have identified the adoption of mind maps as the independent variable and the quality of the backlog as the dependent variable, the latter being measured against the ""function points"" metric. Our hypothesis (i.e., mind maps are effective in increasing the quality of product backlogs) has been tested within an existing SCRUM project (the development of a digital library by an academic institution), and several promising data have been obtained and further discussed."

This paper presents a minimum-time approach to this problem by treating obstacle avoidance and envelope protection as inequality constraints in a state space formulation. The approach is used to study the guidance of a rotary wing \{UAV\} for aggressive maneuvering in avoiding an obstacle while staying within its operational envelope. The Nonlinear Trajectory Generator (NTG) is used as a real-time optimization solver, and load factor and rotor flapping angle are considered as limit parameters. A nonlinear simulation model of a rotary wing test bed within the Georgia Tech Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Simulation Tool (GUST) is used to evaluate the proposed approach."
1684.0,Excluded,ec7,Mining Binary Constraints in the Construction of Feature Models,"Feature models provide an effective way to organize and reuse requirements in a specific domain. A feature model consists of a feature tree and cross-tree constraints. Identifying features and then building a feature tree takes a lot of effort, and many semi-automated approaches have been proposed to help the situation. However, finding cross-tree constraints is often more challenging which still lacks the help of automation. In this paper, we propose an approach to mining cross-tree binary constraints in the construction of feature models. Binary constraints are the most basic kind of cross-tree constraints that involve exactly two features and can be further classified into two sub-types, i.e. requires and excludes. Given these two sub-types, a pair of any two features in a feature model falls into one of the following classes: no constraints between them, a requires between them, or an excludes between them. Therefore we perform a 3-class classification on feature pairs to mine binary constraints from features. We incorporate a support vector machine as the classifier and utilize a genetic algorithm to optimize it. We conduct a series of experiments on two feature models constructed by third parties, to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach under different conditions that might occur in practical use. Results show that we can mine binary constraints at a high recall (near 100% in most cases), which is important because finding a missing constraint is very costly in real, often large, feature models."
1685.0,Excluded,ec3,Mining frequent patterns from dynamic data streams with data load management,"In this paper, we study the practical problem of frequent-itemset discovery in data-stream environments which may suffer from data overload. The main issues include frequent-pattern mining and data-overload handling. Therefore, a mining algorithm together with two dedicated overload-handling mechanisms is proposed. The algorithm extracts basic information from streaming data and keeps the information in its data structure. The mining task is accomplished when requested by calculating the approximate counts of itemsets and then returning the frequent ones. When there exists data overload, one of the two mechanisms is executed to settle the overload by either improving system throughput or shedding data load. From the experimental data, we find that our mining algorithm is efficient and possesses good accuracy. More importantly, it could effectively manage data overload with the overload-handling mechanisms. Our research results may lead to a feasible solution for frequent-pattern mining in dynamic data streams."

Models are often used to describe partial aspects from the whole set of requirements. Hence, flaws and vagueness in requirements are common and hard to discover. Upcoming standards like ISO 26262 request the automotive industry to be more strict and formal on the requirements. Formal notation and unambiguitiy is explicitely stated. In the field of system and acceptance testing requirements are the basis for all activities. Although, requirements are often not close to testing. To overcome this we introduced the Timed Usage Model (TUM) as a formal representation of requirements specification. During the creation of the model the requirements are analyzed and brought into an unambiguous and formal representation. Traceability is achieved, as each path in the model must be based upon a requirement. The formulation of the requirements in form of an unambiguous model clarifies the requirements and helps to detect design errors. During the creation of the model omissions and flaws in the requirements are discovered. The model serves as a communication medium when functionality responsibles are involved to clarify these aspects. Timed Usage Models were created for power train functionality and the energy management. Moreover, the model as a formalized representation of the requirements served as the basis for the whole testing process, including test planning, test case generation, and test campaign analysis."

In the area of requirements engineering (RE) and release planning, prioritization is an established strategy for achieving this goal. Available prioritization approaches, however, do not consider all idiosyncrasies of business-process-driven software development. This lack of appropriate prioritization leads to effort often being spent on (RE) activities of minor importance. To support the requirements engineer in overcoming this problem, the idea of applying different models during prioritization is introduced, which shall bring it to a more reliable basis. Through this notion it is expected to reduce unnecessary (RE) activities by focusing on the most important requirements."

1709.0,Excluded,ec3,Modeling and simulation of open source development using an agile practice,"The goal of this work is to study the effects of the adoption of agile practices on open source development. In particular, we started to evaluate the effects of \{TDD\} (Test Driven Development) since it is easer to apply in a distributed environment than most other agile practices. In order to reach this goal we used the simulation modeling approach. We developed a simulation model of open source software development process. The model was tuned using data from a real \{FLOSS\} project: Apache \{HTTP\} Server. To introduce the \{TDD\} practice in our \{FLOSS\} simulation model, we made some assumptions based on empirical results. The two \{FLOSS\} development models (nonTDD and TDD) were compared. The one incorporating the agile practice yields better results in terms of code quality."
1710.0,Excluded,ec3,Modeling continuous integration practice differences in industry software development,"Abstract Continuous integration is a software practice where developers integrate frequently, at least daily. While this is an ostensibly simple concept, it does leave ample room for interpretation: what is it the developers integrate with, what happens when they do, and what happens before they do? These are all open questions with regards to the details of how one implements the practice of continuous integration, and it is conceivable that not all such implementations in the industry are alike. In this paper we show through a literature review that there are differences in how the practice of continuous integration is interpreted and implemented from case to case. Based on these findings we propose a descriptive model for documenting and thereby better understanding implementations of the continuous integration practice and their differences. The application of the model to an industry software development project is then described in an illustrative case study."

Due to Web applications popularity, the Web is becoming the standard platform for implementing business workflows. In this context, Web applications and their workflows must be adapted to market demands in such a way to minimize development effort. In this work we present a model-driven approach for specifying Web workflows adaptations using a Domain Specific Language for Web application requirement called WebSpec. We present an extension to WebSpec based on Pattern Specifications for dealing with crosscutting workflow requirements by identifying tangled and scattered behaviour and reducing inconsistencies early in the requirement gathering phase. Using simple but illustrative examples we show the expressive power of the approach."
1714.0,Excluded,ec3,Modelling software processes: a focus on objectives,"Existing software process models such as Waterfall and XP are characterised by unstated assumptions, a consequence of which is that we can not easily compare models or transfer data from one model to another. This means that software planners have no mechanism for selecting process activities that are best suited to individual projects. In this paper, we propose a framework for modelling software processes that supports representation and comparison of different kinds of software process. Our framework is based on a lift in focus from 'choosing activities' to 'identifying project objectives and selecting activities to meet those objectives'. We overview some evidence to support the claims of representation and comparison and discuss benefits and limitations of the approach."
1715.0,Excluded,ec7,Models in the RE Series," This paper reports on the use and importance of models in the RE (Requirements Engineering) series of conferences based on the results of an analysis of the use of the word `model' and of other words with `model...' as their stem in the main bodies of the texts of published papers. The 620 papers examined contained 18,066 instances of these words. The words identified were divided into `general terms' for models (505), `special names' for models (215) and names for the `nature and characteristics' of models and modelling (120). The large numbers are a clear indicator of the overall importance which the model has as a dominant concept and as a still proliferating artifact in the practice of those participating in the series. The three groups of names represent social conventions adopted for communication and continuity; the third provides a pragmatically rather than theoretically based overview of the factors affecting models and modelling. The conclusions suggest questions that may improve general practice and form the basis of more specific model declaration."
1716.0,Excluded,ec3,Modern meeting management and information retrieval: automatic protocol generation and meeting work,"Communication is a key component in the daily software project management. It is the quintessential carrier of semantic information. But speech is transient and with it the information exchanged in meetings. To organize a successful meeting, some rules have to be followed. One is to summarize important - said - information in a written protocol to externalize the knowledge shared in the meeting. The act of manually writing meeting minutes implicate a lot of problems. The protocol is published too late, inconsistent, or incomplete, due to the limited perceptivity and time of the protocol writer. Hence, we focus on an approach to automatically generate protocols and make them accessible to the right person. Therefore, keyword spotting, based on a predefined and meeting-type dependent grammar, is applied to meeting recordings and the discussed information is extracted and accordingly pipelined into the project information workflow. This paper presents a lightweight framework of an information and knowledge management approach to capture communication in meetings."
1717.0,Excluded,ec3,Modified agile practices for outsourced software projects,"Frustration with the bureaucratic nature of the disciplined approach has led to the call for agile development. The new approach is defined by the Agile Manifesto (http://agilemanifesto.org/), which values individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer collaboration over contract negotiation, and agility in responding to change over following a prescribed plan. Agile development does not focus on process improvement; instead it focuses on customer satisfaction and employee empowerment. This is evident from reading the stated values and principles of the Agile Manifesto, which include fairly extreme positions such as ""welcome changing requirements, even late in development"" and ""the best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams."" An interesting issue arising from the call for agile development is its role in distributed development, which usually translates to offshore development. A recent study indicates that agile practices can reduce temporal, geographical, and socio-cultural distances in distributed development projects. The study researched agile development between teams located in the U.S. and Ireland, and while it reported that overall communication was improved, it also noted problems related to geographical, temporal, and even language distances. Although there are other reported successes of distributed agile development, the projects are generally small, the team members are likely familiar with each other, and the participants are largely experts or high caliber developers. This raises a research, as well as a practical, question: can we extend the use of agile practices from small projects to medium and large projects that involve a significant outsourcing component? To address this question, we must drop constraints such as small size projects, and expert developers belonging to the same company, and examine problems arising from geographical, temporal, and cultural distances. Accordingly, agile practices may need to be modified. In this article, the key issues of software projects with an outsourced component are first identified. These issues are then used as a background to evaluate how standard agile practices stand up when applied to larger projects. This evaluation is followed by recommendations for modified agile practices for outsourced software projects."
1718.0,Excluded,ec3,Monetary pricing of software development risks: A method and empirical illustration,"The ability to price (monetize) software development risks can benefit various aspects of software development decision-making. This paper presents a risk pricing method that estimates two parameters for every individual risk factor: extra cost incurred per unit exposure, and project sensitivity, to that factor. Since variability is a widely used measure of risk in finance and decision sciences, the method derives risk pricing parameters by relating variability in risk factors to variability in project cost. This approach rests on the fact that a parametric cost estimator predicts project cost by adjusting the â€œnominalâ€� cost of a project based on the expected values of risk factors (cost drivers), but the actual project cost often deviates from prediction because the actual values of risk factors normally deviate from expectations. In addition, to illustrate the viability of the method, the paper applies the method empirically with \{COCOMO\} data, to approximate risk pricing parameters for four risk factors (Personnel Capability, Process Maturity, Technology Platform, and Application Task). Importantly, though, the method could work equally well with data recorded based on other parametric cost estimators. The paper also discusses several areas that can benefit from benchmark risk pricing parameters of the kind we obtain."

In geographically distributed software (GSD)development difficulty with team coordination is the norm. This paper looks at these issues, the research into team mental models, and suggests how project management practices may incorporate the findings to help address coordination issues in GSD."

Monthly sampling from all the sampling sites in five replicates was made for a period of 12 months (July 2002â€“June 2003) at 9:00â€“11:00&#xa0;h. A total of 32 species of macroinvertebrates were found with the Ephemeroptera and Gastropoda being the most abundant component of invertebrates communities. The Shannonâ€“Wiener diversity index calculated for macroinvertebrates ranged from 3.50 to 4.61. Seasonal fluctuations in the density of macroinvertebrates revealed maximum density (451â€“503&#xa0;ind&#xa0;mâˆ’2) during winter and minimum (126â€“143&#xa0;ind&#xa0;mâˆ’2) during monsoon season. The density of macroinvertebrates was influenced by the anthropogenic disturbances and water level fluctuations causing disturbance in the littoral zone of the wetland. The statistical relationships between turbidity, transparency, dissolved oxygen and water temperature and macroinvertebrates of Asan wetland were also computed for assessing the impact of anthropogenic disturbances on macroinvertebrates."
1721.0,Excluded,ec3,Motivating developer performance to improve project outcomes in a high maturity organization,"In this paper we discuss the impact software developer performance has on project outcomes. Project performance remains unreliable in the software industry with many compromised software systems reported in the press. We investigate the impact that developer performance has on aspects of project success and explore how developer performance is motivated. We present interview, focus group and questionnaire data collected from a team of developers working in a software organization that has been assessed at CMM level 5. Our main findings are that developers value technical skills in their colleagues, but appreciate these especially when supplemented with good human skills. Software developers with a proactive, flexible, adaptable approach who are prepared to share knowledge and follow good practice are said to be the best developers. Motivators for these developers are pay and benefits, recognition and opportunities for achievement in their work. Overall, we found that technical competence, interpersonal skills and adherence to good practices are thought to have the biggest impact on software project success."

1723.0,Excluded,ec3,Motivation in software engineering industrial practice: A cross-case analysis of two software organisations,"AbstractContext The research about motivation in software engineering has provided important insights into characterizing factors and outcomes related to motivation. However, the complex relationships among these factors, including the moderating and mediating effects of organisational and individual characteristics, still require deeper explanatory investigation. Objective Our general goal is to build explanatory theories of motivation in different software organisations and to integrate these local theories towards a comprehensive understanding of the role of motivation in the effectiveness of the individuals and the teams in which they work. In this article, we describe the integrative synthesis of the results of two case studies performed with software organisations in different business contexts. Method We performed two case studies using a multiple-case, replication design, focusing on the software engineers as the unit of analysis. For 13&#xa0;months, we conducted semi structured interviews, diary studies, and document analyses, and analysed the collected data using grounded theory procedures. The results of the two cases were synthesized using a meta-ethnography supported process. Results We built translations of the concepts and propositions from the two studies into one another. We then used the translations to build a central story of motivation that synthesizes the individual stories. This synthesis is contextualized by the differences in organisational and individual characteristics. Conclusion The differences in organisational contexts and in the characteristics of the software engineers in each study provided rich explanations for contrasts in perceptions and feelings about motivation in both organisations. The theory that emerged from the synthesis, supported by these explanations, provides a deeper understanding of the interplay between motivators and outcomes, and the needs and personal goals of the software engineers. This theory also characterises the role of team cohesion in motivation, advancing previous models about motivation in software engineering."
1724.0,Excluded,ec3,Motivation in Software Engineering: A systematic literature review,"Objective In this paper, we present a systematic literature review of motivation in Software Engineering. The objective of this review is to plot the landscape of current reported knowledge in terms of what motivates developers, what de-motivates them and how existing models address motivation. Methods We perform a systematic literature review of peer reviewed published studies that focus on motivation in Software Engineering. Systematic reviews are well established in medical research and are used to systematically analyse the literature addressing specific research questions. Results We found 92 papers related to motivation in Software Engineering. Fifty-six percent of the studies reported that Software Engineers are distinguishable from other occupational groups. Our findings suggest that Software Engineers are likely to be motivated according to three related factors: their â€˜characteristicsâ€™ (for example, their need for variety); internal â€˜controlsâ€™ (for example, their personality) and external â€˜moderatorsâ€™ (for example, their career stage). The literature indicates that de-motivated engineers may leave the organisation or take more sick-leave, while motivated engineers will increase their productivity and remain longer in the organisation. Aspects of the job that motivate Software Engineers include problem solving, working to benefit others and technical challenge. Our key finding is that the published models of motivation in Software Engineering are disparate and do not reflect the complex needs of Software Engineers in their career stages, cultural and environmental settings. Conclusions The literature on motivation in Software Engineering presents a conflicting and partial picture of the area. It is clear that motivation is context dependent and varies from one engineer to another. The most commonly cited motivator is the job itself, yet we found very little work on what it is about that job that Software Engineers find motivating. Furthermore, surveys are often aimed at how Software Engineers feel about â€˜the organisationâ€™, rather than â€˜the professionâ€™. Although models of motivation in Software Engineering are reported in the literature, they do not account for the changing roles and environment in which Software Engineers operate. Overall, our findings indicate that there is no clear understanding of the Software Engineersâ€™ job, what motivates Software Engineers, how they are motivated, or the outcome and benefits of motivating Software Engineers."

One means of conducting such research is through industrial case studies. However, there are a number of influencing factors that contribute to the success of such a case study. In this paper, we describe a case study performed at Sabre Airline Solutions evaluating the effects of adopting Extreme Programming (XP) practices with a team that had characteristically plan-driven risk factors. We compare the team's business-related results (productivity and quality) to two published sources of industry averages. Our case study found that the Sabre team yielded above-average post-release quality and average to above-average productivity. We discuss our experience in conducting this case study, including specifics of how data was collected, the rationale behind our process of data collection, and what obstacles were encountered during the case study. We also identify four factors that potentially impact the outcome of industrial case studies: availability of data, tool support, co-operative personnel and project status. We believe that recognizing and planning for these factors is essential to conducting industrial case studies, and that this information will be helpful to researchers and practitioners alike."

Understanding experiences of users when using MPEG-7-based tools is necessary if we are to improve how MPEG-7 metadata is applied in practice. COSMOS-7 enables structured modeling and filtering of MPEG-7-compliant metadata for digital video. We describe two COSMOS-7 front end systems: COSMOSIS, for modeling digital video metadata, and the Filtering Manager, for filtering digital video metadata. We then present an empirical evaluation of these front end systems undertaken with a sample set of end users from a London, UK, theater company. Our results reveal that end users progress through a number of key stages when modeling and filtering video content."

However, conventional tools for parallel performance analysis have serious problems due to the large data volume that needs to be handled. In this paper, we discuss the scalability issue for MPI performance analysis on Blue Gene/L, the world's fastest supercomputing platform. First we present an experimental study of existing MPI performance tools that were ported to BG/L from other platforms. These tools can be classified into two categories: profiling tools that collect timing summaries, and tracing tools that collect a sequence of time-stamped events. Profiling tools produce small data volumes and can scale well, but tracing tools tend to scale poorly. We then describe a configurable MPI tracing tool developed for BG/L. By providing a configurable method for trace generation. the volume of trace data can be controlled, and scalability is significantly improved."

This class of model uses a hierarchical partitioning of the input space with a reinforcement learning algorithm to overcome limitations of previous RL methods. The main contribution of the new system is to provide a flexible and generic model for multi-agent environments. The proposed generic model can be used in several applications, including competitive and cooperative problems, with the autonomous capacity to create fuzzy rules and expand their own rule structures, extracting knowledge from the direct interaction between the agents and the environment, without any use of supervised algorithms. The proposed model was tested in three different case studies, with promising results. The tests demonstrated that the developed system attained good capacity of convergence and coordination among the autonomous intelligent agents."

The set of selected requirements will be developed during the actual iteration. This selection problem can be reformulated as a search problem, allowing its treatment with metaheuristic optimization techniques. This paper studies how to apply Ant Colony Optimization algorithms to select requirements. First, we describe this problem formally extending an earlier version of the problem, and introduce a method based on Ant Colony System to find a variety of efficient solutions.

Systematic conservation planning provides tools to identify optimally located priority areas for conservation. Planning for multiple species promises adequate provision for the needs of a range of threatened species simultaneously. Several studies apply the set-covering problem by minimizing resources for given conservation targets of multiple species. We extend this method by also considering different degrees of coordination in multiple-species conservation planning and representing reserve sizes endogenously. A deterministic, spatially explicit programming model solved with mixed integer programming is used to represent minimum habitat area thresholds for all included biodiversity features. The empirical model application to European wetland species addresses five different scenarios of coordination in conservation planning, including taxonomic, political, and biogeographical coordination of planning. Our approach illustrates and quantifies the efficiency of multi-species conservation activities. We show that maximum coordination in conservation planning enhances area efficiency by 30% compared to no coordination. Furthermore, strong coordination in conservation planning does not only reduce the area requirement, but synergy effects even enable the conservation features to achieve higher conservation objectives. Spatial subdivision of planning, however, leads to highest area requirements and less conservation target achievement."

The multi-radio control in proposed platform is divided into two parts, the light-weight dynamic scheduling with tight real-time constraints to solve the temporal interoperability issues between radios, and the semi-dynamic admission control to perform the resource allocation when a radio changes its behavioral pattern. The control framework was implemented on a SDR technology demonstrator, to show how multiple simultaneously active radios are controlled, and how the coexistence mechanism can be used to provide tangible benefits to the SDR modem user, like the ability to utilize fine-grained spectral holes."
1737.0,Excluded,ec3,Multi-sprint planning and smooth replanning: An optimization model,"Abstract Most agile methods divide a project into sprints (iterations), and include a sprint planning phase that is critical to ensure the project success. Several factors impact on the optimality of a sprint plan, which makes the planning problem difficult. In this paper we formalize the planning problem and propose an optimization model that, given the estimates made by the project team and a set of development constraints, produces a multi-sprint optimal plan that maximizes the business value perceived by users. To cope with the inherent flexibility and uncertainty of agile projects, our approach ensures that a baseline plan can be revised and re-optimized during project execution without disrupting it, which we call smooth replanning. The planning problem is converted into a generalized assignment problem, given a linear programming formulation, and solved using the \{IBM\} \{ILOG\} \{CPLEX\} Optimizer. Our model is validated on both real and synthetic projects. In particular, a case study on two real projects confirms the effectiveness of our approach; as to efficiency, for medium-sized problems an exact solution is found in a few minutes, while for large problems a heuristic solution that is less than 1% far from the exact one is returned in a few seconds. Finally, some smooth replanning tests investigate the trade-off between plan quality and stability."

We obtained responses from 79 agile software development professionals and 8 teams in 13 different countries. Our findings include that over half of developers in our data set find documentation important or even very important but that too little documentation is available in their projects.

The novel functionalities and current research challenges of the xG networks are explained in detail. More specifically, a brief overview of the cognitive radio technology is provided and the xG network architecture is introduced. Moreover, the xG network functions such as spectrum management, spectrum mobility and spectrum sharing are explained in detail.

1752.0,Excluded,ec7,Non-functional requirements in business process modeling,"Business process modeling entails the capture of a set of tasks that invariably model the functional behavior of a system. Another aspect of business process modeling involves the accurate capture of operational behavior and the associated process constraints. Whether the process is automated or manual, such operational constraints and behavior exist. This may include a variety of properties including performance expectations, policy constraints, and security controls. These characteristics later manifest as the non-functional requirements of an intended system, and often such information is generally identified at some point after the business process modeling exercise. The non-functional characteristics of the business are arguably more difficult to capture in business process modeling, since the focus of such methods is the modeling of functional behavior. We propose how two new artifacts may be applied to model the constraints associated with a business process. This is the operating condition to denote a business process constraint and the control case to define controlling criteria to mitigate risk associated with an operational condition. Modeling constraints in this way provides an opportunity to capture these characteristics of business process early in the systems development life-cycle. This contributes to a model that provides a more complete representation of the overall business process. The methods will assist in mitigating risk and facilitate the early discovery of non-functional requirements during systems development."
1753.0,Included,included,NORMATIC: A visual tool for modeling Non-Functional Requirements in agile processes,"There is consensus in the research community that agile software development methodologies, such as Scrum, are becoming more and more popular in delivering quality Functional Requirements (FRs). However, agile methodologies have not adequately modeled Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) and their potential solutions (operationalizations) with FRs in early development phases-let alone having tools to support such initiatives. This research proposes NORMATIC, a Java-based simulation tool for modeling non-functional requirements for semi-automatic agile processes. NORMATIC is the semi-automatic tool that supports the more general Non-Functional Requirements Modeling for Agile Processes (NORMAP) Methodology. Early results show that the tool can potentially help agile software development teams in reasoning about and visually modeling NFRs as first-class artifacts early on during requirements gathering and analysis phases. The tool can also aid project managers and Scrum teams in user story estimate and risk calculations as well as risk-driven planning and visualization of the proposed plans."
1756.0,Included,included,NORPLAN: Non-functional requirements planning for agile processes,"Agile software development and project management methodologies, such as Scrum and Extreme Programming, have become very popular in quickly delivering quality Functional Requirements (FRs). However, agile project management methodologies have not adequately captured planning and prioritization activities for crosscutting concerns and non-functional requirements in agile practices. This research proposes project management and requirements quality metrics that would be used to design a risk-driven algorithm to prioritize and plan an improved requirements implementation sequence that is suitable for agile software development methodologies. Unlike the overly simplistic business value prioritization scheme used in methodologies such as Scrum, Non-functional Requirements Planning (NORPLAN) proposes two additional prioritization schemes, namely, Riskiest-Requirements-First and Riskiest-Requirements-Last for improved yet more agile planning for release and sprint cycles using a risk-driven approach. The approach is validated through visual simulation and a case study. Â© 2013 IEEE."

In this paper, we introduce a multi-objective decision support approach to help balance project risks and duration against overtime, so that software engineers can better plan overtime. We evaluate our approach on 6 real world software projects, drawn from 3 organisations using 3 standard evaluation measures and 3 different approaches to risk assessment. Our results show that our approach was significantly better (p < 0.05) than standard multi-objective search in 76% of experiments (with high Cohen effect size in 85% of these) and was significantly better than currently used overtime planning strategies in 100% of experiments (with high effect size in all). We also show how our approach provides actionable overtime planning results and inves- tigate the impact of the three different forms of risk assessment."

1761.0,Included,included,Novel lightweight engineering artifacts for modeling non-functional requirements in agile processes,"Agile software development methodologies, such as Scrum, have gained tremendous popularity and proven successful in quickly delivering quality Functional Requirements (FRs). However, agile methodologies have not adequately modeled Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) and their potential solutions (operationalizations) with FRs in early development phases. This research proposes three fundamental agile artifacts to model FRs, NFRs, and their potential solutions in a visual environment. First, FRs are modeled through Agile Use Cases (AUCs). Second, NFRs are modeled through Agile Loose Cases (ALCs). Third, NFRs potential solutions are modeled through Agile Choose Cases (ACCs). AUCs are newly proposed hybrid of use cases and agile user stories. ALCs are proposed loosely-defined agile NFRs. ACCs are proposed potential solutions (operationalizations) for ALCs. The three artifacts are combined in a visual framework to promote agile modeling of NFRs (primarily) and how they are linked to FRs. The artifacts are the building blocks of a more comprehensive framework for modeling NFRs in agile software development processes. Â© 2012 IEEE."

To help structural researchers and engineers get familiar with sensing technologies and select the most effective sensors, this study reviewed and categorized new sensing techniques for full-scale structural testing applications. The researchers of this study categorized sensors used for civil-infrastructure testing into traditional contact sensors and remote sensors based upon their application methodologies, and into cabled sensors and wireless sensors based upon their data communication strategies.

While many studies have looked at novice computer science students, very little research has been conducted on professional novices. We conducted a two-month in-situ qualitative case study of new software developers in their first six months working at Microsoft. We shadowed them in all aspects of their jobs: coding, debugging, designing, and engaging with their team, and analyzed the types of tasks in which they engage. We can explain many of the behaviors revealed by our analyses if viewed through the lens of newcomer socialization from the field of organizational man-agement. This new perspective also enables us to better understand how current computer science pedagogy prepares students for jobs in the software industry. We consider the implications of this data and analysis for developing new processes for learning in both university and industrial settings to help accelerate the transition from novice to expert software developer."
1764.0,Excluded,ec7,Numerical Modelling of Autonomous Agent Movement and Conflict,"The world that we live in is filled with large scale agent systems, from diverse fields such as biology, ecology or finance. Inspired by the desire to better understand and make the best out of these systems, we propose to build stochastic mathematical models, in particular G-networks models. With our approach, we aim to provide insights into systems in terms of their performance and behavior, to identify the parameters which strongly influence them, and to evaluate how well individual goals can be achieved. Through comparing the effects of alternatives, we hope to offer the users the possibility of choosing an option that address their requirements best. We have demonstrated our approach in the context of urban military planning and analyzed the obtained results. The results are validated against those obtained from a simulator (Gelenbe et al. in simulating the navigation and control of autonomous agents, pp 183–189, 2004a; in Enabling simulation with augmented reality, pp 290–310, 2004b) that was developed in our group and the observed discrepancies are discussed. The results suggest that the proposed approach has tackled one of the classical problems in modeling multi-agent systems and is able to predict the systems’ performance at low computational cost. In addition to offering the numerical estimates of the outcome, these results help us identify which characteristics most impact the system. We conclude the paper with potential extensions of the model."
1765.0,Excluded,ec3,Object-centric debugging,"During the process of developing and maintaining a complex software system, developers pose detailed questions about the runtime behavior of the system. Source code views offer strictly limited insights, so developers often turn to tools like debuggers to inspect and interact with the running system. Unfortunately, traditional debuggers focus on the runtime stack as the key abstraction to support debugging operations, though the questions developers pose often have more to do with objects and their interactions. We propose object-centric debugging as an alternative approach to interacting with a running software system. We show how, by focusing on objects as the key abstraction, natural debugging operations can be defined to answer developer questions related to runtime behavior. We present a running prototype of an object-centric debugger, and demonstrate, with the help of a series of examples, how object-centric debugging offers more effective support for many typical developer tasks than a traditional stack-oriented debugger."
1766.0,Excluded,ec3,Object-oriented design processes of electronic commerce in a multi-agent environment,"Corporations are moving from traditional management into a world of agile and electronic business. Such businesses have continually sought to develop information technology (IT) systems, in order to assist in the decision-making of the business process. Due to rapid changes in the business environment this process is subject to ongoing examination. To ensure the agility of electronic commerce, business design process problems must be addressed by a team of specialists or intelligent agents, and be based on object-oriented design, characterized by computability, reusability, and exchangeability. This paper proposes a multi-agent system encompassing an object-oriented approach, to design processes for electronic commerce. This approach entails solutions to design processes, for decision-makers who are geographically separated and operate on differing computer platforms. By combining various objects, different types of design processes can be solved with the same agent-based framework, making this approach very responsive. The proposed methodology is applied to a real-world construct that involves combining objects to complete an electronic commerce model: in particular the logistics objective."
1767.0,Excluded,ec3,Object-oriented encapsulation for dynamically typed languages,"Encapsulation in object-oriented languages has traditionally been based on static type systems. As a consequence, dynamically-typed languages have only limited support for encapsulation. This is surprising, considering that encapsulation is one of the most fundamental and important concepts behind object-oriented programming and that it is essential for writing programs that are maintainable and reliable, and that remain robust as they evolve."

We also describe an implementation of object-oriented encapsulation in Smalltalk. Benchmarks of this implementation show that extensive use of object-oriented encapsulation results in a slowdown of less than 15 percent."
1769.0,Excluded,ec3,On a labeling problem in graphs,"Motivated by applications in software programming, we consider the problem of covering a graph by a feasible labeling. Given an undirected graph G = ( V , E ) , two positive integers k and t , and an alphabet Î£ , a feasible labeling is defined as an assignment of a set L v âŠ† Î£ to each vertex v âˆˆ V , such that (i) | L v | â‰¤ k for all v âˆˆ V and (ii) each label Î± âˆˆ Î£ is used no more than t times. An edge e = { i , j } is said to be covered by a feasible labeling if L i âˆ© L j â‰  0Ì¸ . G is said to be covered if there exists a feasible labeling that covers each edge e âˆˆ E . In general, we show that the problem of deciding whether or not a tree can be covered is strongly NP-complete. For k = 2 , t = 3 , we characterize the trees that can be covered and provide a linear time algorithm for solving the decision problem. For fixed t , we present a strongly polynomial algorithm that solves the decision problem; if a tree can be covered, then a corresponding feasible labeling can be obtained in time polynomial in k and the size of the tree. For general graphs, we give a strongly polynomial algorithm to resolve the covering problem for k = 2 , t = 3 ."
1770.0,Included,included,On agile performance requirements specification and testing,"Underspecified performance requirements can cause performance issues in a software system. However, a complete, upfront analysis of a software system is difficult, and usually not desirable. We propose an evolutionary model for performance requirements specifications and corresponding validation testing. The principles of the model can be integrated into agile development methods. Using this approach, the performance requirements and test cases can be specified incrementally, without big upfront analysis. We also provide a post hoc examination of a development effort at IBM that had a high focus on performance requirements. The examination indicates that our evolutionary model can be used to specify performance requirements such that the level of detail is commensurate with the nature of the project. Additionally, the IBM experience indicates that test driven development-type validation testing corresponding to the model can be used to determine if performance objectives have been met"
1772.0,Excluded,ec3,On designing a usable interactive system to support transplant nursing,"Solid organ transplant has been steadily increasing in number both nationally and internationally. Caring for the transplant patients in the hospital setting, right after the patient is moved from the intensive care unit to the ward, is one of the most challenging tasks in nursing. It involves many procedures, rigid protocols, tight monitoring, and intensive data gathering for use by the other coordinating healthcare professionals. The complexity is further increased when a nurse has to take care of several transplant patients in a single shift. Of late, there has been a growth of computer applications in nursing and clinical information systems. Their acceptability and usability determine the ultimate success of computer support for this complex task. In this paper, we present a case study in which we combine two well-known software engineering techniquesâ€”namely, agile programming and user centered designâ€”toward the goal of developing an interactive system for supporting the activities of transplant nurses in a hospital setting. This has resulted in a usable end-product and the user centered approach has motivated the nurses to move towards the use of computers in their jobs for better productivity. The productâ€™s usability was formally evaluated and is reported herein. The strengths and limitations of this approach are also discussed. The software product developed has been well accepted and is currently being planned to replace the manual methods followed in the transplant ward of a large metropolitan hospital."
1773.0,Excluded,ec7,On Eliciting Contribution Measures in Goal Models," Goal models have been found to be useful for supporting the decision making process in the early requirements phase. Through measuring contribution degrees of low-level decisions to the fulfilment of high-level quality goals and combining them with priority statements, it is possible to compare alternative solutions of the requirements problem against each other. But where do contribution measures come from and what is the right way to combine them in order to do such analysis? In this paper we describe how full application of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) can be used to quantitatively assess contribution relationships in goal models based on stakeholder input and how we can reason about the result in order to make informed decisions. An exploratory experiment shows that the proposed procedure is feasible and offers evidence that the resulting goal model is useful for guiding a decision. It also shows that situation-specific characteristics of the requirements problem at hand may influence stakeholder input in a variety of ways, a phenomenon that may need to be studied further in the context of eliciting such models."

Continuing the agent-based Internetware model presented in a previous paper, in this paper, after an analysis of the behavioral patterns and the technical challenges of environment-driven applications, a software-structuring model is proposed for environment-driven Internetware applications. A series of explorations on the enabling techniques for the model, especially the modeling, management and utilization of context information are presented. Several prototypical systems have also been built to prove the concepts and evaluate the techniques. These research efforts make a further step toward the Internetware paradigm by providing an initial framework for the construction of context-aware and self-adaptive software application systems in the open network environment."
1775.0,Excluded,ec3,On establishing the essential components of a technology-dependent framework: a strawman framework for industrial case study-based research,"A goal of evidence-based software engineering is to provide a means by which industry practitioners can make rational decisions about technology adoption. When a technology is mature enough for potential widespread use, practitioners find empirical evidence most compelling when the study has taken place in a live, industrial situation in an environment comparable to their own. However, empirical software engineering is in need of guidelines and standards to direct industrial case studies so that the results of this research are valuable and can be combined into an evidentiary base. In this paper, we present a high-level view of a measurement framework that has been used with multiple agile software development industrial case studies. We propose that this technology-dependent framework can be used as a strawman for a guideline of data collection, analysis, and reporting of industrial case studies. Our goal in offering the framework as a strawman is to solicit input from the community on a guideline for the essential components of a technology-dependent framework for industrial case study research."
1776.0,Excluded,ec3,On guiding the augmentation of an automated test suite via mutation analysis,"Mutation testing has traditionally been used as a defect injection technique to assess the effectiveness of a test suite as represented by a “mutation score.” Recently, mutation testing tools have become more efficient, and industrial usage of mutation analysis is experiencing growth. Mutation analysis entails adding or modifying test cases until the test suite is sufficient to detect as many mutants as possible and the mutation score is satisfactory. The augmented test suite resulting from mutation analysis may reveal latent faults and provides a stronger test suite to detect future errors which might be injected. Software engineers often look for guidance on how to augment their test suite using information provided by line and/or branch coverage tools. As the use of mutation analysis grows, software engineers will want to know how the emerging technique compares with and/or complements coverage analysis for guiding the augmentation of an automated test suite. Additionally, software engineers can benefit from an enhanced understanding of efficient mutation analysis techniques. To address these needs for additional information about mutation analysis, we conducted an empirical study of the use of mutation analysis on two open source projects. Our results indicate that a focused effort on increasing mutation score leads to a corresponding increase in line and branch coverage to the point that line coverage, branch coverage and mutation score reach a maximum but leave some types of code structures uncovered. Mutation analysis guides the creation of additional “common programmer error” tests beyond those written to increase line and branch coverage. We also found that 74% of our chosen set of mutation operators is useful, on average, for producing new tests. The remaining 26% of mutation operators did not produce new test cases because their mutants were immediately detected by the initial test suite, indirectly detected by test suites we added to detect other mutants, or were not able to be detected by any test."
1777.0,Excluded,ec7,On Human Analyst Performance in Assisted Requirements Tracing: Statistical Analysis," Assisted requirements tracing is a process in which a human analyst validates candidate traces produced by an automated requirements tracing method or tool. The assisted requirements tracing process splits the difference between the commonly applied time-consuming, tedious, and error-prone manual tracing and the automated requirements tracing procedures that are a focal point of academic studies. In fact, in software assurance scenarios, assisted requirements tracing is the only way in which tracing can be at least partially automated. In this paper, we present the results of an extensive 12 month study of assisted tracing, conducted using three different tracing processes at two different sites. We describe the information collected about each study participant and their work on the tracing task, and apply statistical analysis to study which factors have the largest effect on the quality of the final trace."

Yet there is a scarcity in the literature of discussions focused on the practical and methodological challenges of this particular research context. Objective This paper formulates and addresses a number of questions regarding the applicability of qualitative methodologies for the study of \{FOSS\} communities. It reflects on the challenges of such approaches as seen in previous research efforts and discusses how they manifest in research practice through a thorough description of a case study of a community called PyPy. Method The paper primarily discusses interpretive research approaches which are based on ethnographic data collection methods. The study under discussion was an exploratory case study utilizing multiple methods, including participant observation, virtual ethnography, and open-ended questionnaires. Grounded Theory was used for data analysis. Results Two broad sets of challenges are highlighted in relation to the multidimensionality of the \{FOSS\} phenomenon and the difficulty of qualitative analysis of activities in long-term context. Additional issues identified relate to potential problems with focus and the need for reflexivity, but also to the extent of the study and the importance of maintaining an active relationship with the core community group. Conclusion This paper provides an overview â€“ grounded in practical research experience and linked to insights from the literature â€“ of methodological issues in the specific research area of qualitative studies of \{FOSS\} communities, which up until now has been lacking."

This paper describes experiences in testing web services in the context of a project that is utilising an iterative development process. The project, GIMI (Generic Infrastructure for Medical Informatics), is developing a pervasive service-oriented data fabric to support a variety of healthcare applications. We focus primarily on the planning and implementation of the tests utilised within GIMI, and explore the different steps of our regression testing approach.

1780.0,Included,included,On Requirements Verification for Model Refinements," Conventional formal verification techniques rely on the assumption that a system's specification is completely available so that the analysis can say whether or not a set of properties will be satisfied. On the contrary, modern development lifecycles call for agileincremental and iterativeapproaches to tame the boosting complexity of modern software systems and reduce development risks. We focus here on requirements verification performed in the early exploratory stages on high-level models and we discuss how this can be integrated into an agile approach. We present a new technique to model-check incomplete high-level specifications against formally specified requirements. We do this in the context of incomplete hierarchical Statecharts, verified against a variation of CTL properties. Our approach supports step-wise specification and refinement verification. Verification can be incremental, that is alternative refinements may be separately explored and verification is only replayed for the modified parts. The results are presented by introducing the formalisms, the model-checking algorithm, and the tool we have implemented."
1781.0,Excluded,ec3,On system design,"In this essay, I consider some of the factors that are making it more and more difficult to expend the effort necessary to do system design. Because of changes in the economics of the field in both industry and research, we have become less able to take the time needed to do real system design, and to train the next generation of designers. Because of the intellectual property landscape, we are less able to discuss system design. The end result is that we do less good system design than we used to, at least in those environments where system design used to be most common. But there are reasons to be optimistic about the future of system design, which appears to be happening in non-traditional ways and in non-traditional venues."
1782.0,Excluded,ec3,On test suite composition and cost-effective regression testing,"Regression testing is an expensive testing process used to revalidate software as it evolves. Various methodologies for improving regression testing processes have been explored, but the cost-effectiveness of these methodologies has been shown to vary with characteristics of regression test suites. One such characteristic involves the way in which test inputs are composed into test cases within a test suite. This article reports the results of controlled experiments examining the effects of two factors in test suite composition---test suite granularity and test input grouping---on the costs and benefits of several regression-testing-related methodologies: retest-all, regression test selection, test suite reduction, and test case prioritization. These experiments consider the application of several specific techniques, from each of these methodologies, across ten releases each of two substantial software systems, using seven levels of test suite granularity and two types of test input grouping. The effects of granularity, technique, and grouping on the cost and fault-detection effectiveness of regression testing under the given methodologies are analyzed. This analysis shows that test suite granularity significantly affects several cost-benefit factors for the methodologies considered, while test input grouping has limited effects. Further, the results expose essential tradeoffs affecting the relationship between test suite design and regression testing cost-effectiveness, with several implications for practice."
1783.0,Excluded,ec3,On the economic evaluation of XP projects,"From a project economics point of view, the most important practices of Extreme Programming (XP) are Pair Programming and Test-Driven Development. Pair Programming leads to a large increase in the personnel cost, and Test-Driven Development adds to the development effort. On the other hand, pp can speed the project up, both pp and Tdd can reduce the defect density of the code. Can the increased cost of XP be balanced by its shorter time to market and higher code quality? To answer this question, we construct a new model for the business value of software projects. We then analyze the cost and benefit of XP by applying our model to a realistic sample project. We systematically vary important model parameters to provide a sensitivity analysis. Our analysis shows that the economic value of, XP strongly depends on how large the XP speed and defect advantage really are. We also find that the market pressure is an important factor when assessing the business value of XP., Our study provides clear guidelines for managers when to consider using XP -- or better not."
1784.0,Excluded,ec3,On the existence of high-impact refactoring opportunities in programs,"The refactoring of large systems is difficult, with the possibility of many refactorings having to be done before any useful benefit is attained. We present a novel approach to detect starting points for the architectural refactoring of large and complex systems based on the analysis and manipulation of the type dependency graph extracted from programs. The proposed algorithm is based on the simultaneous analysis of multiple architectural antipatterns, and outputs dependencies between artefacts that participate in large numbers of instances of these antipatterns. If these dependencies can be removed, they represent high-impact refactoring opportunities: a small number of changes that have a major impact on the overall quality of the system, measured by counting architectural antipattern instances. The proposed algorithm is validated using an experiment where we analyse a set of 95 open-source Java programs for instances of four architectural patterns representing modularisation problems. We discuss some examples demonstrating how the computed dependencies can be removed from programs. This research is motivated by the emergence of technologies such as dependency injection frameworks and dynamic component models. These technologies try to improve the maintainability of systems by removing dependencies between system parts from program source code and managing them explicitly in configuration files."

Among the several possible engineering cases, we are particularly interested here in the joint use of i* with other modelling frameworks to obtain what we call i*-based frameworks. In this context, several challenges need to be overcome: theoretical, technical, methodological and community-related. In this paper, we review current i*-based frameworks under several possible scenarios and observe that not all of these challenges are always addressed, and even more, there is lack of guidelines or well-accepted methodological design steps on how to overcome these issues. Then, we detail the several engineering artifacts and techniques whose consideration in i*-based frameworks may help to overcome them. To illustrate the vision, we present the case of combining i* with data warehouse models, from the initial definition of the ontology to the final implementation using profiles. Finally, we provide a research agenda to apply the proposed vision including a final reflection on defining a maturity model as a convenient way to support forthcoming research in the topic."
1786.0,Excluded,ec3,On the possibilities of (pseudo-) software cloning from external interactions,"This paper discusses some initial investigations into the application of genetic programming technology as a vehicle for re-examining some existing approaches within the software life-cycle. Specifically, it outlines a new direction in production techniques—software cloning from executable specifications or source code. It explores the possibility and advantages of producing a system from its external interactions. To allow this production to be automatic, the system assumes that it can view (and potentially manipulate) these external interactions of the original system; and hence it assumes the existence of either an executable specification or the source code—an object to assist in the generation of the external interactions; i.e. the system is treated as a black-box. Although the generation and application of software clones is relatively unexplored, it is believed that this is a fundamental technology that can have many different applications within a software engineering environment. For example, software clones could be used in: complexity measurement, software testing and software fault tolerance. Clearly, for these clones to be usable, their production needs to be automated. An interesting approach to this automatic production or generation problem is the application of evolutionary-based Genetic Programming (GP). Using the paradigms of best fit, selection, crossover and mutation, a number of clones, satisfying specific requirements, can be automatically generated. In general, GP is a flexible and powerful algorithm suitable for solving a variety of different problems. This paper presents the results of studies that have been conducted in order to answer questions related to feasibility of using GP for clone generation: what features of GP are important? What works and what does not? How can the GP be “tuned” for the problem? The results have been used to draw a set of suggestions and conclusions that indicate possible usability of GP-based approach to automatic generation of clones."
1787.0,Excluded,ec3,On the responsibilities of software architects and software engineers in an agile environment: who should do what?,"As there is considerable freedom for software workers to decide what to do in an agile environment, there is a need to be explicit about social aspects such as task ownership between roles and the agility in owning those tasks. We have conducted interviews and a survey at a large organization to explore these issues. The results indicate that there are areas where architects and software engineers have different views on task ownership. Some of the less exciting tasks such as documentation and issue clarification then easily become a hot potato nobody wants."
1788.0,Excluded,ec3,On the role of tests in test-driven development: a differentiated and partial replication,"Background: Test-Driven Development (TDD) is claimed to have positive effects on external code quality and programmers’ productivity. The main driver for these possible improvements is the tests enforced by the test-first nature of TDD as previously investigated in a controlled experiment (i.e. the original study). Aim: Our goal is to examine the nature of the relationship between tests and external code quality as well as programmers’ productivity in order to verify/ refute the results of the original study. Method: We conducted a differentiated and partial replication of the original setting and the related analyses, with a focus on the role of tests. Specifically, while the original study compared test-first vs. test-last, our replication employed the test-first treatment only. The replication involved 30 students, working in pairs or as individuals, in the context of a graduate course, and resulted in 16 software artifacts developed. We performed linear regression to test the original study’s hypotheses, and analyses of covariance to test the additional hypotheses imposed by the changes in the replication settings. Results: We found significant correlation (Spearman coefficient = 0.66, with p-value = 0.004) between the number of tests and productivity, and a positive regression coefficient (p-value = 0.011). We found no significant correlation (Spearman coefficient = 0.41 with p-value = 0.11) between the number of tests and external code quality (regression coefficient p-value = 0.0513). For both cases we observed no statistically significant interaction caused by the subject units being individuals or pairs. Further, our results are consistent with the original study although there were changes in the timing constraints for finishing the task and the enforced development processes. Conclusions: This replication study confirms the results of the original study concerning the relationship between the number of tests vs. external code quality and programmer productivity. Moreover, this replication allows us to identify additional context variables, for which the original results still hold; namely the subject unit, timing constraint and isolation of test-first process. Based on our findings, we recommend practitioners to implement as many tests as possible in order to achieve higher baselines for quality and productivity."
1789.0,Excluded,ec7,On the Secure Software Development Process: CLASP and SDL Compared,"Development processes for software construction are common knowledge and mainstream practice in most development organizations. Unfortunately, these processes offer little support in order to meet security requirements. Over the years, research efforts have been invested in specific methodologies and techniques for secure software engineering, yet complete, dedicated processes have been proposed only recently. In this paper, two high-profile processes for the development of secure software, namely OWASP's CLASP and Microsoft's SDL, are evaluated and compared in detail. The paper identifies the commonalities, discusses the specificity of each approach, and proposes suggestions for improvement."
1791.0,Included,included,On the Usage of Context for Requirements Elicitation: End-User Involvement in IT Ecosystems," Today's systems are faced with the need of constant evolution to remain competitive, especially when looking at IT Ecosystems and their growing number of subsystems. As a prerequisite for these to stay competitive, system providers need a clear understanding of their stakeholder's needs. As systems tend to be increasingly complex nowadays, support an increasingly number of stakeholders, have a shorter release cycles to evolve and need to adapt to the environment and the users, some of the standard requirements elicitation techniques tend not to be suitable any more. Especially when adaptivity is necessary, system providers need to understand the context, in which the systems are used, but also the context of users for the adaptation. In this paper I concentrate on the largest stakeholder group, namely the end-users for requirements elicitation. Evaluation criteria include (i) support of context, (ii) scalability to large numbers of end-users, and (iii) scalability to large numbers of end-user's needs and problems that lead to new requirements. My literature review suggests that this important field is currently underrepresented in Requirements Engineering research. This research proposes to develop a framework that explains the different context types and their role for requirements elicitation. The framework is then used to investigate existing requirements elicitation techniques and their potential for considering context. It is also used to show how emerging techniques can further support requirements elicitation with context."
1792.0,Excluded,ec7,On the Use of Requirements for Driving Call-for-Tender Processes for Procuring Coarse-grained OTS Components," Because of their complexity, software systems are currently built by integrating components of different nature into hybrid architectures, usually including some third party Off-The-Shelf (OTS) components. Several methods have been proposed to support OTS component selection. Most of them work by comparing requirements, incrementally gained though several iterations, and component descriptions. However, the iterative nature of these methods makes them practically unsuitable in some cases, particularly when conducting call-for-tender-based processes for selecting coarse-grained OTS components. In these cases, company goals need to be thoughtfully and systematically engineered to obtain a well structured set of requirements, which is to remain static during the entire procurement process and cannot be validated through hands-on experimentation. In this paper we report a case study in the selection of an ERP system for a telecommunications company using a call-for-tender process. We present the activities that were undertaken to elicit, analyze and structure the requirements to be included in call-for-tender documents, and the evaluation of components based on the identification of mismatches between requirements and component capabilities."
1793.0,Excluded,ec3,On using planning poker for estimating user stories,"While most studies in psychology and forecasting stress the possible hazards of group processes when predicting effort and schedule, agile software development methods recommend the use of a group estimation technique called planning poker for estimating the size of user stories and developing release and iteration plans. It is assumed that the group discussion through planning poker helps in identifying activities that individual estimators could overlook, thus providing more accurate estimates and reducing the over-optimism that is typical for expert judgment-based methods. In spite of the widespread use of agile methods, there is little empirical evidence regarding the accuracy of planning poker estimates. In order to fill this gap a study was conducted requiring 13 student teams to develop a Web-based student records information system. All teams were given the same set of user stories which had to be implemented in three Sprints. Each team estimated the stories using planning poker and the estimates provided by each team member during the first round were averaged to obtain the statistical combination for further comparison. In the same way the stories were estimated by a group of experts. The study revealed that studentsâ€™ estimates were over-optimistic and that planning poker additionally increased the over-optimism. On the other hand, the expertsâ€™ estimates obtained through planning poker were much closer to actual effort spent and tended to be more accurate than the statistical combination of their individual estimates. The results indicate that the optimism bias caused by group discussion diminishes or even disappears as the expertise of the people involved in the group estimation process increases."

This environment includes diverse, and perhaps, distributed teams requiring close coordination with multidisciplinary skills -- information architecture, visual design, XML, Java and others. The potential is to make the development process more responsive to users' needs and changing business requirements. This could have high impact on outcomes of the development process, decreasing cost, decreasing time to deployment, and increasing user satisfaction. The challenges are to adapt and reconcile the corporate and the agile culture processes and methodologies without seriously compromising either. We will discuss our experience from conception into implementation of XP through the first release that incorporates several iteration cycles. We will discuss the positive and negative forces and how they have or have not been resolved to date."

1800.0,Included,included,Ontology based application model for feature driven development,"The upcoming technology support for semantic web promises fresh directions for Software Engineering community. Also semantic web has its roots in knowledge engineering that provoke software engineers to look for application of ontology applications throughout the Software Engineering lifecycle. The internal components of a semantic web are ""light weight"", and may be of less quality standards than the externally visible modules. In fact the internal components are generated from external (ontological) component. That's the reason agile development approaches such as Feature Driven Development (FDD) are suitable for application's internal component development. The FDD process is based on its first step of developing the ""overall model"" which is build using the information in requirement document and later used for deriving the feature list but there is no particular representation for this model that can be used for checking the quality of model. Considering such model as a requirement, we propose ontology based derivation of overall model that can be used for checking the quality of model and later be used for generation of features from it. Advantages of ontology-based feature Driven development are also discussed."
1801.0,Excluded,ec3,Ontology-based multi-site software development methodology and tools,"The disadvantages associated with remote communication rather than face-to-face communication is a key problem in the multi-site distributed software development environment. Awareness of what work has been done, what task has been misunderstood, what problems have been raised, what issues have been clarified, and understanding of why a team or a software engineer does not follow the project plan, and how to carry out a discussion over a multi-site distributed environment and to make a just-in-time decision are the challenge. Different teams might not be aware of what tasks are being carried out by others, potentially leading to problems such as two groups overlapping in some work or other work not being performed due to misinterpretation of the task. Wrong tasks may be carried out due to ignorance of who to contact to get the proper details. If everyone working on a certain project is located in the same area, then situational awareness is relatively straightforward but the overheads in communications to get together to discuss the problems, to raise issues, to make decisions and to find answers in a multi-site distributed environment can become very large. Consequently, these problems cause project delay and anxiety among teams and managers. Ontologies coupled with a multi-agents system allow greater ease of communication by aggregating the agreed knowledge about the project, the domain knowledge, the concepts of software engineering into a shared information resource platform and allow them to be shared among the distributed teams across the sites and enable the intelligent agents to use the ontology to carry out initial communication and classification with developers when the problem is raised in the first instance. In this paper, we present the key challenges in multi-site software engineering and the ontology representation of commonly shared conceptualisations in software development. We demonstrate the agent communication with developers in the form of manâ€“machine interactions and the great potential of such a system to be used in the future for software engineering in multi-site environments."

1805.0,Excluded,ec3,Operational definition and automated inference of test-driven development with Zorro,"Test-driven development (TDD) is a style of development named for its most visible characteristic: the design and implementation of test cases prior to the implementation of the code required to make them pass. Many claims have been made for TDD: that it can improve implementation as well as design quality, that it can improve productivity, that it results in 100% coverage, and so forth. However, research to validate these claims has yielded mixed and sometimes contradictory results. We believe that at least part of the reason for these results stems from differing interpretations of the TDD development style, along with an inability to determine whether programmers actually follow whatever definition of TDD is in use. Zorro is a system designed to automatically determine whether a developer is complying with an operational definition of Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices. Automated recognition of TDD can benefit the software development community in a variety of ways, from inquiry into the “true nature” of TDD, to pedagogical aids to support the practice of test-driven development, to support for more rigorous empirical studies on the effectiveness of TDD in both laboratory and real world settings. This paper describes the Zorro system, its operational definition of TDD, the analyses made possible by Zorro, two empirical evaluations of the system, and an attempted case study. Our research shows that it is possible to define an operational definition of TDD that is amenable to automated recognition, and illustrates the architectural and design issues that must be addressed in order to do so. Zorro has implications not only for the practice of TDD, but also for software engineering “micro-process” definition and recognition through its parent framework, Software Development Stream Analysis."
1807.0,Excluded,ec7,Optimal return policy and modular design for build-to-order products,"A build-to-order product gives the firm the opportunity to customize the product to the requirement of the customers. The firm will see an increase in demand, but face some operational difficulties. One of these is related to the return policy which is now a recognized tool to win customer orders. This is even more true for increasingly popular Internet sales where the opportunity to physically examine the product is absent. A tremendous advantage can be gained by the Internet firm if it could offer a return policy for \{BTO\} products. We propose the use of modularity in the product design as a solution to this problem. From manufacturer's point of view, following a policy of modularization and offering a generous return policy would increase revenue, but also increase the cost due to increased likelihood of return and increased cost of design. We develop a profit maximization model to jointly obtain optimal polices for return policy and modularity level in terms of certain market reaction parameters. We obtain a number of managerial guidelines for using marketing and operational strategy variables to influence those reaction parameters so as to obtain the maximum benefit from the market."

Coaches ensure the process is ldquodone rightrdquo and help teams with process problems. The need to develop project-embedded ADR coaches and to raise the level of agile maturity to reduce missteps drove the need for internal coach training.

Unfortunately, because most enterprises view technology as a proprietary differentiating element of their operation, little is known about the extent of \{OSS\} adoption in industry and the key drivers behind adoption decisions. In this article we examine factors and behaviors associated with the adoption of \{OSS\} and provide empirical findings through data gathered from the \{US\} Fortune-1000 companies. The data come from each company's web browsing and serving activities, gathered by sifting through more than 278 million web server log records and analyzing the results of thousands of network probes. We show that the adoption of \{OSS\} in large \{US\} companies is significant and is increasing over time through a low-churn transition, advancing from applications to platforms. Its adoption is a pragmatic decision influenced by network effects. It is likelier in larger organizations and those with many less productive employees, and is associated with \{IT\} and knowledge-intensive work and operating efficiencies."

We provide the state-of-the-art in OSSs, and discuss mechanisms to support OSS-related decisions in software engineering (e.g., choosing the OSS best fitting development scenarios). Our data supports two conclusions. First, software engineering focused on building software using project teams alone, yet these are one of thirteen OSS flavors from literature. Second, an emerging OSS should be further explored for software development: social networks. This article represents a first glimpse at OSS-aware software engineering, that is, to engineer software using OSSs best fit for the problem."
1812.0,Excluded,ec7,Organizing knowledge workforce for specified iterative software development tasks,"Abstract Organizing knowledge workers for specific tasks in a software development process is critical for the success of software projects. Assigning workforce in software projects represents a dynamic and complex problem that concerns the utilization of cross-trained knowledge workers who possess different productivities and error tendencies in coding and defect correction. This complexity is further compounded when the development process follows a software release life cycle and involves major releases of alpha, beta, and final versions in the context of iterative software development. We study this knowledge workforce problem from three essential project management perspectives: (1) timeliness â€” obtaining shortest development time; (2) effectiveness â€” satisfying budget constraint; and (3) efficiency â€” achieving high workforce utilization. We explore ideal workforce composites with two strategic focuses on productivity and quality and with different scenarios of workload ratios. An analytical model is formulated and a meta-heuristic approach based on particle swarm optimization is used to derive solutions in a simulation experiment. Our findings suggest that forming an ideal workforce composite is a non-trivial task and task assignments with divergent focuses for software projects under different workload scenarios require different planning strategies. Practical implications are drawn from our findings to provide insight on effectively planning workforce for software projects with specific goals and considerations."

The Bilateration Ranging Transponder (BRT) System (BRTS) supports range and Doppler measurements for each \{TDRS\} using standard user tracking services. These measurements are used to generate well-determined ephemerides for the TDRSs. \{TDRSS\} provides S-band and Ku-band services through the single access (SA) antennas and S-band services through the S-band multiple access (SMA) phased array. \{TDRSS\} is capable of supporting coherent range and two-way Doppler tracking as well as noncoherent one-way return-link and one-way forward-link Doppler tracking of user spacecraft. Accurate one-way return-link tracking, which can use SMA, the most available \{TDRSS\} resource, requires a stable oscillator onboard the user spacecraft as the source of frequency. Two-way and one-way return-link tracking measurements are used for ground orbit determination for navigation and precise positioning; one-way forward-link tracking is used for autonomous onboard navigation with achievable accuracies better than those of the Global Positioning System (GPS) Precise Positioning System (PPS). This overview will discuss the various tracking and navigation capabilities of TDRSS, as well as many of the operational and research applications that have been conducted for missions such as Landsat-4, Ocean Topography Experiment (TOPEX)/Poseidon (T/P), Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), and Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE)."

Understanding these factors, and properly deploying people resources can help managers improve quality outcomes. This paper considers the impact of code ownership and developer experience on software quality. In a large project, a file might be entirely owned by a single developer, or worked on by many. Some previous research indicates that more developers working on a file might lead to more defects. Prior research considered this phenomenon at the level of modules or files, and thus does not tease apart and study the effect of contributions of different developers to each module or file. We exploit a modern version control system to examine this issue at a fine-grained level. Using version history, we examine contributions to code fragments that are actually repaired to fix bugs. Are these code fragments ""implicated"" in bugs the result of contributions from many? or from one? Does experience matter? What type of experience? We find that implicated code is more strongly associated with a single developer's contribution; our findings also indicate that an author's specialized experience in the target file is more important than general experience. Our findings suggest that quality control efforts could be profitably targeted at changes made by single developers with limited prior experience on that file."

A total of 128 students majoring in Management Information Systems, Information Systems, and Information Technology participated in the experiment. Of the 68 undergraduates, 40 were first-year students and 28 were juniors; the remaining 60 were Masterâ€™s degree graduate students.

During the first two visits, a set of four programming problems was used in four programming sessions lasting 45&#xa0;min each; two were individual programming sessions and two were pair programming sessions. At the end of each visit, a questionnaire was administered and collected. The questionnaire results revealed that the various Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality combinations did not significantly influence the levels of communication, satisfaction, confidence, and compatibility. The pairs that exhibited a high level of communication between partners did not necessarily experience a high level of satisfaction or exhibit compatibility between partners, nor did they have a high level of confidence regarding the finished product. The communication skill level seemed to have an impact on communication only. Similar to many previous gender-focused literatures, the same gender pairs did exhibit significantly higher levels of communication, satisfaction and compatibility than the mixed gender pairs. Within the same gender pairs, the femaleâ€“female pairs showed a much higher level than the maleâ€“male pairs in those categories.

Among the various methodologies or practices proposed, pair programming, which is concerned with two programmers collaborating on design, coding and testing, has become a controversial focus of interest. Even though some success stories have been reported with the use of pair-programming in real software development environment, many people remain rather skeptical of the claims on pair-programming productivity. Previous studies in pair programming have only addressed the basic understanding of the productivity of pairs and they have not addressed the variation in productivity between pairs of varying skills and experience, such as between noviceâ€“novice and expertâ€“expert. Statistical productivity measurements reported by different researchers also seem to lead to contradictory conclusions. Until now, the literature has not addressed how those results and experiments were related to each other. In this paper, we propose a controlled experiment called repeat-programming which can facilitate the understanding of relationships between human experience and programming productivity. Repeat-programming can be performed when controversial issues in non-traditional programming methodologies and development productivity need to be investigated into. To illustrate how the proposed empirical experiment can put arguable, divisive problems into perspective, we have examined the productivity in pair programming as a case study. With repeat-programming, we are able to (i) better understand why results of previous pair programming control experiments reached different conclusions as to the productivity of pair programming and (ii) most importantly, present a case in which noviceâ€“novice pairs against novice solos are much more productive than expertâ€“expert pairs against expert solos."

Using qualitative analysis, we performed a large-scale card sort to group the various benefits and problems of pair programming. The biggest perceived benefits of pair programming were the introduction of fewer bugs, spreading code understanding, and producing overall higher quality code.

Being a new company (established 2004), without legacy software and with the freedom to make new choices, it was decided that the agent abstraction offered both short-term software engineering and longer-term business advantages. This expectation has been borne out in practice, in that it has been possible to construct an e-trading platform, using a 4-person team over a period of a few months, and that is now part of a live business operation handling just over 12,000 transactions daily. In this paper we explain how agents helped focus attention on the responsibilities of key software functions, how different functions should interact with one another and how to identify and propagate key performance indicator information through the system to detect unexpected behaviour. Agent technology has many potential benefits for dynamic fast-moving businesses where software requirements change quickly and business needs grow rapidly, all within a dynamic environment that has entirely different rules across the axes of geography, market, customer and competitor.

It differed from most reported user-informed design by having an explicit dual purpose. On the one hand, the prototype should provide significant, measurable improvements for the field site. On the other hand, the project sponsor did not intend to develop the prototype into a product but rather identify future opportunities and needs in the small-to-medium health care sector, requirements for next generation multifunction peripherals (MFPs), and business applications of existing technology. Thus, the project simultaneously investigated specific solutions for a specific work practice while looking for key technologies to address future needs. This paper provides a detailed account of the process and results, highlighting particular contingencies that come with a dual-purpose exploration, as well as the benefits of a small, focused team that ""oscillates"" between research and deployment."

It provides a case study of a large agile development project and focusses on how customers and users participated in agile development and design activities in practice. The investigated project utilized the agile method eXtreme Programming. Planning games, user stories and story cards, working software, and acceptance tests structured the customer and user involvement. We found genuine customer and user involvement in the design activities in the form of both direct and indirect participation in the agile development project. The involved customer representatives played informative, consultative, and participative roles in the project. This led to their functional empowerment- the users were enabled to carry out their work to their own satisfaction and in an effective, efficient, and economical manner.

1829.0,Excluded,ec3,Pattern rewriting framework for event processing optimization,"A growing segment of event-based applications require both strict performance goals and support in the processing of complex event patterns. Event processing patterns have multiple complexity dimensions: the semantics of the language constructs (e.g., sequence) and the variety of semantic interpretations for each pattern (controlled by policies). We introduce in this paper a novel approach for pattern rewriting that aims at efficiently processing patterns which comprise all levels of complexity. We present a formal model for pattern rewriting and demonstrate its usage in a comprehensive set of rewriting techniques for comple pattern types, taking various semantic interpretations into account. A cost model is presented, balancing processing latency and event throughput according to user's preference. Pattern cost is then estimated using simulation-based techniques. This work advances the state-of-the-art by analyzing complex event processing logic and by using explicit means to optimize elements that were considered ""black box."" Our empirical study yields encouraging results, with improvement gain of up to tenfold relative to the non optimized solutions that are used in the current state-of-the-art systems."
1830.0,Excluded,ec3,Patterns for agile development practice part 3 (version 4),"This set of ten patterns is intended to complement the standard wisdom that can be gleaned from the Agile Development literature such as Kent Beck's Extreme Programming Explained[1]. It is directed primarily at those who are starting out with Extreme Programming or another agile methodology and might miss some subtle ideas. Once a team gains experience these patterns will become obvious, but initially some of them are counter intuitive. While this study began in Extreme Programming practice, most of the advice applies to agile development in general. The ten patterns here extend the work of 2004--2006 on the same topic ([3] and [4]). This paper contains some of the standard practices of Extreme Programming as detailed in [1]. We consider XP to be a pattern language in which the practices are the basis of the patterns. They have the characteristics of a true Pattern Language in that they are synergistic and generative. The dozen or so practices detailed in Beck and elsewhere, such as ""Do the simplest thing that could possibly work"" and ""Yesterday's Weather"", form a subset of this language. As this ""language"" is in its early stages of development, there is no significance to the current ordering of the patterns here. This paper presents ten of the one hundred or so patterns developed so far. Many of these patterns are listed briefly in the Thumbnail section at the end."

However, maintaining documentation's consistency requires a considerable effort. Existing solutions encompass different tools and approaches that support the process of creating, evolving and using documents and other artifacts derived from the software development process. Based on existing literature and expertise, we have identified the key problems and solutions for documentation consistency. In concrete, four distinct patterns and their relations were identified, which are here described --- Information Proximity, Co-Evolution, Domain-Structured Information and Integrated Environment."
1832.0,Excluded,ec3,Patterns for global development: how to build one global team?,"Global Development has become a mainstream trend. Many companies today conduct development projects in teams which are distributed across sites and countries. While Global Development brings several advantages such as proximity to markets and customers, access to local talent and cost competitiveness, it also introduces new challenges: Geographic distance, cultural differences and different time zones make communication much more difficult and inefficient. One of the main problems in Global Development is the impact of distribution on team cohesion. To create a trust relationship among team members becomes more important than ever. In this paper, we present a collection of patterns that can help to build one global team and to improve the effectiveness of communication and collaboration in Global Development projects."
1833.0,Included,included,Perceived productivity threats in large agile development projects,"Applying agile methodology in large software development projects introduces many challenges. For example, one may expect that the combination of autonomous teams and the necessity for an overall organizational control structure may lead to conflicts, and one may expect that Agile's informal means of knowledge sharing breaks down as the number of project participants increases. Such issues may in turn compromise the project's productivity. In order to better understand potential threats to productivity in large agile development projects, we conducted repertory grid interviews with 13 project members on their perceptions of threats to productivity. The project was a large software development project consisting of 11 Scrum teams from three different subcontractors. The repertory grid sessions produced 100 issues, which were content analyzed into 10 main problem areas: (1) Restraints on collaboration due to contracts, ownership, and culture, (2) Architectural and technical qualities are given low priority, (3) Conflicts between organizational control and flexibility, (4) Volatile and late requirements from external parties, (5) Lack of a shared vision for the end product, (6) Limited dissemination of functional knowledge, (7) Excessive dependencies within the system, (8) Overloading of key personnel, (9) Difficulties in maintaining well-functioning technical environments, (10) Difficulties in coordinating test and deployment with external parties. Using critical-case reasoning, we claim that projects deploying agile practices in projects with less favorable conditions than those enjoyed in the current project, and that are larger and more complex, are likely to face similar challenges."

An analysis of the survey shows serious shortcomings including inadequate or missing definitions of performance, reactive ""fix it later"" mentality, vague performance requirements, and a general lack of awareness of the practices developed by the Software Performance Engineering (SPE) community. The survey is followed by guidelines for teaching SPE to undergraduates based on a semester long course we have developed. It is our plan to incorporate these guidelines into the curriculum of our senior capstone software engineering course."
1838.0,Excluded,ec3,Performance on Agile Teams: Relating Iteration Objectives and Critical Decisions to Project Management Success Factors,"AbstractContext While project management success factors have long been established via the golden triangle, little is known about how project iteration objectives and critical decisions relate to these success factors. It seems logical that teamsâ€™ iteration objectives would reflect project management success factors, but this may not always be the case. If not, how are teamsâ€™ objectives for iterations differing from the golden triangle of project management success factors? Objective This study identifies iteration objectives and the critical decisions that relate to the golden triangle of project management success factors in agile software development teams working in two-week iterations. Method The author conducted semi-structured interviews with members across three different agile software development teams using a hybrid of \{XP\} and Scrum agile methodologies. Iteration Planning and Retrospective meetings were also observed. Interview data was transcribed, coded and reviewed by the researcher and two independently trained research assistants. Data analysis involved organizing the data to identify iteration objectives and critical decisions to identify whether they relate to project management success factors. Results Agile teams discussed four categories of iteration objectives: Functionality, Schedule, Quality and Team Satisfaction. Two of these objectives map directly to two aspects of the golden triangle: schedule and quality. The agile teamsâ€™ critical decisions were also examined to understand the types of decisions the teams would have made differently to ensure success, which resulted in four categories of such decisions: Quality, Dividing Work, Iteration Amendments and Team Satisfaction. Conclusion This research has contributed to the software development and project management literature by examining iteration objectives on agile teams and how they relate to the golden triangle of project management success factors to see whether these teams incorporate the golden triangle factors in their objectives and whether they include additional objectives in their iterations. Whatâ€™s more, this research identified four critical decisions related to the golden triangle. These findings provide important insight to the continuing effort to better assess project management success, particularly for agile teams."
1839.0,Excluded,ec3,Perpetual development: A model of the Linux kernel life cycle,"Software evolution is widely recognized as an important and common phenomenon, whereby the system follows an ever-extending development trajectory with intermittent releases. Nevertheless there have been only few lifecycle models that attempt to portray such evolution. We use the evolution of the Linux kernel as the basis for the formulation of such a model, integrating the progress in time with growth of the codebase, and differentiating between development of new functionality and maintenance of production versions. A unique element of the model is the sequence of activities involved in releasing new production versions, and how this has changed with the growth of Linux. In particular, the release follow-up phase before the forking of a new development version, which was prominent in early releases of production versions, has been eliminated in favor of a concurrent merge window in the release of 2.6.x versions. We also show that a piecewise linear model with increasing slopes provides the best description of the growth of Linux. The perpetual development model is used as a framework in which commonly recognized benefits of incremental and evolutionary development may be demonstrated, and to comment on issues such as architecture, conservation of familiarity, and failed projects. We suggest that this model and variants thereof may apply to many other projects in addition to Linux."

As part of a larger study an XP development team was investigated using a repertory grid approach (this is discussed in detail) to determine whether coherent personalities and characteristics emerge for different roles. The results, which are inevitably limited, suggest that this is the case. Further work remains to be done to build a large corpus of data for future analysis before firm mappings can be made between appropriate personality characteristics and software development roles."
1841.0,Excluded,ec3,Perspective-driven IT talent acquisition,"This paper presents a theoretical framework based on exploratory research so IT managers can plan and procure their organization's IT skills more effectively. Open-ended interviews revealed that IT managers have difficulty in describing specific profiles of the ideal IT candidate. In contrast, IT managers are very specific for an existing open position. Yet, when asked about their IT skills portfolio (at the organizational or individual level), both IT managers and IT professionals had difficulty in articulating its strengths and weaknesses. This is partly because IT is rapidly changing and evolving, often unpredictably. In addition, while the existing IT skills taxonomies have commonalities, their anchors are arbitrary choices of career levels, technologies, job domains, task types and responsibility levels. These taxonomies often confuse IT professionals because there are no many bases for anchoring skills. This proposed framework uses three skills management perspectives (task-oriented, fundamental skill, and socio-cultural) to prioritize the countless IT skills into more manageable scopes. The combination of critical factors for a job position (technology/firm specificity, job tenure, organization size) dictates which perspective is most appropriate, thus giving to an IT manager a focus for analyzing IT skills."
1842.0,Excluded,ec7,Persuading Software Development Teams to Document Inspections: Success," Peer reviews have been identified as one of the best practices in requirements engineering. The most formal peer review technique - inspection - has been found to be effective for the discovery of defects in documents. Nonetheless, many software companies practice inspections infrequently or not at all. For instance, some engineers consider inspections to be uncreative work that adds costs. This paper describes the success factors and challenges involved in persuading review teams to document inspections. The case study utilized an action research approach over a 10-year period, during which two separate attempts were made to address inspection practices. Document inspections did not gain a sustainable position in the study. Consequently, key success factors and challenges were identified in order to explain how the review teams changed their perception throughout the adoption of document inspection. Long-term engagement to document inspection requires motivation and commitment on the part of the teams, and the favorable development culture of an organization, dedicated champions, and the careful tailoring of inspection practices seem to positively influence this. In the long run, it can be challenging to keep document inspections consistent with the existing values, previous experiences, and needs of the software development teams."
1843.0,Excluded,ec3,Phase wise effort estimation for software maintenance: an extended SMEEM model,"Software maintenance through extreme programming approach requires a dedicated algorithmic cost estimation process due to lack of algorithmic approaches for estimating cost, size and duration in agile methodology. Existing approaches of software maintenance estimation such as ACT, FP and COCOMO 2.0 reuse model are based on traditional methods of software development. Software Maintenance Effort Estimation Model (SMEEM) is an estimation method that incorporates various value adjustment factors affecting the estimation of the maintenance project [2]. The SMEEM model generates the more realistic and precise estimation results for agile and extreme programming based maintenance environment. The SMEEM Model calculates and adjusts size of maintenance effort but it is unable to estimate phase wise effort, which is crucial to determine the accurate estimates. In this paper, effort estimation technique is proposed for maintenance project that estimates phase wise effort. This technique employs empirical data from industry practitioners and PG students for phase effort estimation. The proposed technique is illustrated and validated using a case study in subsequent section. It provides more realistic result as compare to the existing techniques on maintenance effort estimation and helpful in estimating phase wise maintenance effort in extreme programming based maintenance environment."

We were consuming all product development resources satisfying commitments made to existing customers, which seriously limited our ability to react to new requirements and improve our competitive edge in the market. In the face of this resource strain, we needed to add a series of smaller, plug-in type products to our existing offering. Of course, this environment required 100% focus on day-to-day tasks and tactical issues, leaving no time or energy for looking ahead. Compounding these problems were the same issues that every company faces. A lack of trust between functional groups, with Product Development on one side and Sales and Support on the other; and, very few people in the company knew what work was being done in Product Development. When stepping back from the situation, we realized that all of the problems could be grouped into three general categories - prioritization, collaboration and visibility. To improve each of these areas, we developed the Product Input and Planning (PIP) process. PIP is a cross-functional, cross-product way of building a roadmap by prioritizing work, balancing competitiveness and customer-driven requirements, and improving product-related communication in all directions within the company. The PIP Team is responsible for prioritizing and building an 18-month roadmap, focusing on the future direction of the company, while Product Management and Product Development focus on delivering the current releases. This paper is not what one would call a success story, though it unquestionably has a moral. The PIP process as described herein exists no longer. Several factors contributed to its morphing into a different kind of family. The lessons learned over the course of the lifetime of PIP, however, are applicable to almost any large-scale, cross-functional endeavor."

MASC integrates and extends our earlier middleware called the Web Services Message Bus (wsBus). In particular, we discuss MASC support for customization of Web services compositions to address business exceptions and wsBus support for correction (fault management) of Web services compositions to improve reliability. We have evaluated the former support on a stock trading case study and the latter support on a supply chain management case study. Our solutions are complementary to the existing approaches and provide: coordination of fault management between SOAP messaging and business process orchestration, greater diversity of monitoring and control constructs, specification of both technical and business aspects used for adaptation decisions, higher level of abstraction easier for use by non-technical people, and externalization of monitoring and adaptation actions from definitions of business processes."

1850.0,Excluded,ec6,POPT: a problem-oriented programming and testing approach for novice students,"There is a growing interest of the Computer Science education community for including testing concepts on introductory programming courses. Aiming at contributing to this issue, we introduce POPT, a Problem-Oriented Programming and Testing approach for Introductory Programming Courses. POPT main goal is to improve the traditional method of teaching introductory programming that concentrates mainly on implementation and neglects testing. According to POPT, students skills must be developed by dealing with ill-defined problems, from which students are stimulated to develop test cases in a table-like manner in order to enlighten the problems requirements and also to improve the quality of generated code. This paper presents POPT and a case study performed in an Introductory Programming course of a Computer Science program at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. The study results have shown that, when compared to a Blind Testing approach, POPT stimulates the implementation of programs of better external quality - the first program version submitted by POPT students passed in twice the number of test cases (professor-defined ones) when compared to non-POPT students. Moreover, POPT students submitted fewer program versions and spent more time to submit the first version to the automatic evaluation system, which lead us to think that POPT students are stimulated to think better about the solution they are implementing."
1851.0,Excluded,ec3,PorchLight: a tag-based approach to bug triaging,"Bug triaging is an important activity in any software development project. It involves developers working through the set of unassigned bugs, determining for each of the bugs whether it represents a new issue that should receive attention, and, if so, assigning it to a developer and a milestone. Current tools provide only minimal support for bug triaging and especially break down when developers must triage a large number of bug reports, since those reports can only be viewed one-by-one. This paper presents PorchLight, a novel tool that uses tags, attached to individual bug reports by queries expressed in a specialized bug query language, to organize bug reports into sets so developers can explore, work with, and ultimately assign bugs effectively in meaningful groups. We describe the challenges in supporting bug triaging, the design decisions upon which PorchLight rests, and the technical aspects of the implementation. We conclude with an early evaluation that involved six professional developers who assessed PorchLight and its potential for their day-to-day triaging duties."
1852.0,Excluded,ec7,Position paper: approach for architectural design and modelling with documented design decisions (ADMD3),"Documented design decisions simplify the evolution of software systems. However, currently design decisions are often either badly documented or are not documented at all. Relations between requirements, decisions, and architectural elements are missing, and architecture alternatives are not preserved. As a consequence it is hard to identify deprecated design solutions when requirements change In this position paper, we present an approach to document software architecture design decisions, together with related requirements and related architectural elements, through the goal-driven elicitation of those requirements needed to make a design decision. Therefore, we propose a process model and supporting meta-models, including a meta-model for a pattern catalogue. The speciality of this pattern catalogue is the inclusion of questions to drive requirements engineering to validate pattern selections, and to guide choosing the most appropriate pattern variant. The paper concludes with a discussion on the assumptions of the approach and possible approaches to empirical validation."

The paper develops a complete positioning-based framework to assess the feasibility of supporting secondary communications on frequencies which are released by primary spectrum management methodologies. In particular, the paper analyzes four possible combinations, depending on known/unknown positions of primary/secondary transceivers. Afterwards, the paper focuses on a specific applicability case, where the dynamic spectrum management mechanism of a WCDMA-based network operator aims at releasing certain frequencies in a large area when possible and thus facilitating secondary exploitation of the released spectrum. Moreover, some practical examples are introduced to show the different procedures when secondary networks with infrastructure are sharing the same frequency with a mobile network. In this context, results have been obtained to assess the practical usability of the released spectrum under different conditions as well as the efficiency of different dynamic spectrum management methodologies."

However, it is still unclear what precisely constitutes agile ISD. Objective Based on four empirical studies conducted over a 10-year time period from 1999 to 2008 the objective of this paper is to show how the meaning and practice of agile \{ISD\} has evolved over time and on this basis to speculate about what comes next. Method Four phases of research has been conducted, using a grounded theory approach. For each research phase qualitative interviews were held in American and/or Danish companies and a grounded theory was inductively discovered by careful data analysis. Subsequently, the four unique theories have been analyzed for common themes, and a global theory was identified across the empirical data. Results In 1999 companies were developing software at high-speed in a desperate rush to be first-to-market. In 2001 a new high-speed/quick results development process had become established practice. In 2003 changes in the market created the need for a more balanced view on speed and quality, and in 2008 companies were successfully combining agile and plan-driven approaches to achieve the benefits of both. The studies reveal a two-stage pattern in which dramatic changes in the market causes disruption of established practices and process adaptations followed by consolidation of lessons learnt into a once again stable software development process. Conclusion The cyclical history of punctuated process evolution makes it possible to distinguish pre-agility from current practices (agility), and on this basis, to speculate about post-agility: a possible next cycle of software process evolution concerned with proactively pursuing the dual goal of agility and alignment through a diversity of means."
1858.0,Excluded,ec3,Poster: can it be more practical?: improving mouse dynamics biometric performance,"Mouse dynamics is the process of verifying the identity of computer users on the basis of their mouse operating characteristics, which are derived from the movement and click events. Some researchers have explored this domain and reported encouraging results, but few focused on applicability in a realistic setting. Specifically, many of the existing approaches require an impractically long verification time to achieve a reasonable accuracy. In this work, we investigate the mouse dynamics of 26 subjects under a tightly-controlled environment. Using procedural features such as speed and acceleration curves to more accurately characterize mouse activity, and adopting distance metrics to overcome the within-class variability, we achieved a promising performance with a false-acceptance rate of 8.87%, a false-rejection rate of 7.16%, and an average verification time of 11.8 seconds. We find that while this level of accuracy comes close to meeting the requirements of identity verification, a tradeoff must be made between security and user acceptability. We also suggest opportunities for further investigation through additional, controlled experimental environments."

Based on the experience of the large success of web applications in desktop computing, a similar paradigm shift from target-specific to cross-platform applications could be foreseen in the mobile software industry. Development and marketing practices should understand this philosophy, learn from similar experiences and identify its advantages and disadvantages, to exploit the potential of the opportunities and anticipate to the challenges that changing a development paradigm brings forth. Our objective is to promote discussion by introducing a series of questions to understand how the use of target-agnostic products may shift the mobile application outlook."

It argues that, given the increased complexity, uncertainty and organisational embeddedness faced by RE in practice, power and politics have become increasingly relevant factors, and that they have not as yet been given adequate consideration. Building upon recent relevant research, a research agenda is proposed that presents a methodological framework which examines power and politics through the structure of power relations and the process of decision-making. This framework will require validation through empirical research as a first step to developing models of power and politics that could be of practical use for RE."

1866.0,Excluded,ec7,Practical Challenges for Methods Transforming i* Goal Models into Business Process Models," The field of requirements engineering for business processes has grown during the last several years. As business processes are assumed to fulfil organizational goals, goal models could be transformed into business process models that specify how business processes fulfil the organizational goals. Although both the fields of Goal-Oriented RE (GORE) and Business Process Management (BPM) received a lot of attention from researchers, the methods to transform goal models into business process models still need further research. This scientific evaluation paper analyses current methods to identify the practical challenges that need to be addressed for an effective transformation of goal models into business process models. We illustrate the discovered challenges using the case study of Seven-Eleven Japan. The main challenges that were discovered are a lack of responsible role, insufficient concept mappings, informality of the transformation algorithm, no full support for organisational structure and a lack of inter-model consistency checks. Our expected contribution of discovering these challenges is to lower the barriers of transferring new goal-to-process methods to industry. As we consider i* constructs the most adequate in GORE for our purposes, we limit our study to transformations that start from i* goal models."
1867.0,Included,included,Pragmatic web service design: An agile approach with the service responsibility and interaction design method,"Service-Oriented Architectures (SOAs) are increasingly deployed to achieve distributed systems that are modular, flexible and extensible. However, designing for SOA can be challenging; there are issues involving the granularity of the cooperating services, problems with proprietary data models being exchanged, and there are no currently accepted conventions for describing a service or its interactions at an abstract level. This paper gives an overview of the Service Responsibility and Interaction Design Method (SRI-DM), an agile approach for engineering a Web Service design based on capturing a scenario as a use-case, factoring this into a set of Service Responsibility and Collaboration Cards, and constructing a Sequence diagram illustrating their interactions in fulfilling the scenario. Through two case studies the paper shows how using SRI-DM can expose many of the problems of over-engineering SOA and help to create simpler, more pragmatic web service designs."

In computational science, this situation is in the extreme, requiring highly specific domain knowledge paired with skills in tuning parallel programs for optimal performance on specific hardware. These projects often take place in very small teams, or by an individual researcher, who must embody both the scientist and the software engineer. Through observation of a range of computational science projects, and the implementation of rigorous software engineering methods in larger projects, we can reflect on where to bring some of the formality of software engineering into computational science. As part of the iVEC Education Program we provide training to eResearchers, which provides an opportunity to prepare scientists for software projects. By infusing the training program with Software Engineering principles, we can provide best practice essentials to the scientists whose code may eventually need to be scaled to multiple processors, platforms, sites, users and developers. By promoting easily adopted, high-return techniques, we hope to develop a culture where quality is intrinsic, reuse is maximised and effort can be focussed on innovative, robust science."

1872.0,Excluded,ec7,Prioritization of Quality Requirements: State of Practice in Eleven Companies," Requirements prioritization is recognized as an important but challenging activity in software product development. For a product to be successful, it is crucial to find the right balance among competing quality requirements. Although literature offers many methods for requirements prioritization, the research on prioritization of quality requirements is limited. This study identifies how quality requirements are prioritized in practice at 11 successful companies developing software intensive systems. We found that ad-hoc prioritization and priority grouping of requirements are the dominant methods for prioritizing quality requirements. The results also show that it is common to use customer input as criteria for prioritization but absence of any criteria was also common. The results suggests that quality requirements by default have a lower priority than functional requirements, and that they only get attention in the prioritizing process if decision-makers are dedicated to invest specific time and resources on QR prioritization. The results of this study may help future research on quality requirements to focus investigations on industry-relevant issues."
1873.0,Excluded,ec7,Privacy Arguments: Analysing Selective Disclosure Requirements for Mobile Applications," Privacy requirements for mobile applications offer a distinct set of challenges for requirements engineering. First, they are highly dynamic, changing over time and locations, and across the different roles of agents involved and the kinds of information that may be disclosed. Second, although some general privacy requirements can be elicited a priori, users often refine them at runtime as they interact with the system and its environment. Selectively disclosing information to appropriate agents is therefore a key privacy management challenge, requiring carefully formulated privacy requirements amenable to systematic reasoning. In this paper, we introduce privacy arguments as a means of analysing privacy requirements in general and selective disclosure requirements (that are both content- and context-sensitive) in particular. Privacy arguments allow individual users to express personal preferences, which are then used to reason about privacy for each user under different contexts. At runtime, these arguments provide a way to reason about requirements satisfaction and diagnosis. Our proposed approach is demonstrated and evaluated using the privacy requirements of BuddyTracker, a mobile application we developed as part of our overall research programme."

The approach described integrates HCI (human computer interaction) instruments. The implemented HCI instruments are: user studies, extreme personas (a variation of the personas approach), usability expert evaluations, usability tests, and automated usability evaluations. By combining XP and UCD (user centered development) processes we take advantages of both approaches."
1875.0,Excluded,ec7,Problem frame patterns: an exploration of patterns in the problem space,"A problem frame is a generic, abstract description of the structure of a problem. Using a problem frame requires selecting a candidate frame from a catalog and mapping the specific parts of the problem into the principal parts of the frame. In this paper we present five patterns, one for each of Jackson's original problem frames. We hope that by writing about problem frames as patterns, we can make the frames themselves and their structure more explicit, and so expose problem frames to a wider audience."

1877.0,Excluded,ec7,Problems in the interplay of development and \{IT\} operations in system development projects: A Delphi study of Norwegian \{IT\} experts,"Context The assumption of the presented work is that the ability of system developers and \{IT\} operations personnel to cooperate effectively in system development projects has great impact on the quality of the final system solution, as well as on the service level of its subsequent operation. Objective The present research explores the interplay of system development and \{IT\} operations and the challenges they are meeting. We are especially interested in identifying problems encountered between these two parties in system development projects. Method We identify and rank problems by using a ranking-type Delphi study. We involved 42 Norwegian \{IT\} experts and split them into three expert panels: system developers, \{IT\} operations personnel and system owners. We then guided them through the three phases of the Delphi method â€“ brainstorming, reduction and ranking. Results A comprehensive list of 66 problems, organized into seven groups, is compiled. Through a selection and ranking procedure, the panels found the following to be the six most serious problems in the interplay of system development and \{IT\} operations: (1) \{IT\} operations not being involved in the requirements specification; (2) poor communication and information flow; (3) unsatisfactory test environments; (4) lack of knowledge transfer; (5) systems being put into production before they are complete; and (6) operational routines not being established prior to deployment. Conclusion The sheer amount and variety of problems mentioned and the respondentsâ€™ explanations confirm that this interplay needs attention; the parties agree that they do not cooperate effectively in development projects. The results imply that \{IT\} operations should be regarded as an important stakeholder throughout several systems development activities, especially requirements analysis, testing and deployment. Moreover, such involvement should be facilitated by an increased focus on enhancing cooperation and communication."

The aim is to explore the alternatives to process control in GBLE development and provide guidelines for planning and carrying out process control in GBLE projects. This study is a part of the research project Human-Centered Design of Game-Based Learning Environments. The overall aim of the project is to construct a multidisciplinary and user-driven process for the development of digital GBLEs. The study was conducted according to the principles of development research and action research. The action research cycles consisted of four game development projects. The results of the study indicate that GBLE development has many uncertainties that advocate the use of empirical process control. The study also provides guidelines of using empirical process control in concert with human-centered design, game design and learning-goal oriented game concept creation in GBLE development."

1951.0,Excluded,ec7,Process models for agent-based development,"A great deal of research in the area of agent-oriented software engineering (AOSE) focuses on proposing methodologies for agent systems, i.e., on identifying the guidelines to drive the various phases of agent-based software development and the abstractions to be exploited in these phases. However, very little attention has been paid so far to the engineering process subjacent to the development activity, disciplining the execution of the different phases involved in the software development. In this paper, we focus on process models for software development and put these in relation with current researches in AOSE. First, we introduce the key concepts and issues related to software processes and present the various software process models currently adopted in mainstream software engineering. Then, we survey the characteristics of a number of agent-oriented methodologies, as they pertain to software processes. In particular, for each methodology, we analyze which software process model it (often implicitly) underlies and which phases of the process are covered by it, thus enabling us to identify some key limitations of currently methodology-centered researches. On this basis, we eventually identify and analyze several open issues in the area of software process models for agent-based development, calling for further researches and experiences."
1952.0,Excluded,ec7,Process variability management in global software development: a case study,"Global Software Development (GSD) is set to be the paradigm that will support software industries in the increasingly globalized 21st century. It opens the door to companies from emerging countries to compete for their own gap in the market. It does, however, still bring some challenges with it. It must integrate different cultures, work styles, and work timetables in the same development process. In fact, GSD methodologies do indeed include specific activities to coordinate different work teams, but they fail precisely where any other methodology does: in the need to be truly useful by meeting the distinct cultural requirements of every organization involved, all at the same time. Up to now, process tailoring has been managed through variability mechanisms. Since these successfully merge original structure with cultural assets, they are also useful for adjusting global methodologies so that they suit each particular development context. This paper presents a case study of the use of the Variant-Rich Process paradigm (VRP) to support tailoring in a GSD methodology. It reveals the suitability of the VRP mechanisms, given that they support the two tailoring dimensions a GSD project involves, i.e., they take into account the circumstances of the entire global project, as well as the need to fit the internal characteristics of each organization; furthermore, they save effort in the tailoring process."
1953.0,Excluded,ec7,Process-centered review of object oriented software development methodologies,"We provide a detailed review of existing object-oriented software development methodologies, focusing on their development processes. The review aims at laying bare their core philosophies, processes, and internal activities. This is done by using a process-centered template for summarizing the methodologies, highlighting the activities prescribed in the methodology while describing the modeling languages used (mainly diagrams and tables) as secondary to the activities. The descriptions produced using this template aim not to offer a critique on the methodologies and processes, but instead provide an abstract and structured description in a way that facilitates their elaborate analysis for the purposes of improving understanding, and making it easier to tailor, select, and evaluate the processes."
1954.0,Excluded,ec7,Product lines for digital information products,"The growth of the Web has fueled the creation, storage, and exchange of digital information products (DIPs), whose main purpose is the delivery of information, entertainment, education, or training. Very often, after their initial creation, the growing amount of content also leads to a more complicated maintenance, since updates typically occur rather often and the potential variability of modifications is not limited in advance. Moreover, commonalities between different parts of similar information products are not exploited, which often leads to redundancy. At the moment, there is hardly any attempt to compose information products from different sources and to produce more complex information products in a coordinated way. To help remedy this situation, this paper introduces the Product Lines for digitAl iNformation producTs (PLANT) approach, which applies the concept of software product lines to DIPs. The \{PLANT\} approach explicitly manages the commonalities of similar \{DIPs\} by defining common requirements, limiting variability in advance, as well as planning and coordinating reuse. This article focuses on the modeling of such product lines. In particular, the developed general concepts will be exemplified throughout the paper in the area of e-learning, in which \{DIPs\} play an important role. The application of \{PLANT\} in other areas and an implemented tool that supports the creation of information products in a product line are outlined as well."
1955.0,Excluded,ec3,Product structure (BOM)-based product similarity measures using orthogonal procrustes approach,"In geometry, two configurations are called similar if they can be brought to a complete match by rigid motions and dilations. In the simplest case, product designs X and Y have the same dimensionality and same number of points which can be brought into a one to one correspondence by substantive considerations. Under orthogonal transformations, product design Y can only be rotated and reflected in order to approximate product design X. As for the â€œas close as possibleâ€� or â€œrelatively closeâ€� criterion, a reasonable definition would be to measure the distances between corresponding points, square these values, and add them to obtain the sum-of-squares criterion L. In this paper, a product structure (BOM)-based product similarity measures using orthogonal procrustes approach is proposed. A structural product is first transformed into bill of materials (BOM), the structural similarity measurement between a product query and target product is calculated and evaluated using orthogonal procrustes approach. The results show that the proposed product structure similarity measure method can help companies find desired product information based on \{BOM\} feature."

The customer is critical to agile projects, but there is little research, experience, or advice about effective practices required to fill that role. We present a set of patterns describing the key roles on a customer team, and the practices that enable customers to fill those roles. By adopting these roles and practices, customers and development teams can increase the velocity and reliability of their projects, and ensure all participants in a project, not just the developers, can work at a sustainable pace."
1959.0,Excluded,ec3,Progress on standardization and automation in software development on \{W7X\},"For a complex experiment like \{W7X\} being subject to changes all along its projected lifetime the advantages of a formalized software development method have already been stated [1]. Quality standards like ISO/IEC-12207 provide a guideline for structuring of development work and improving process and product quality. A considerable number of tools has emerged supporting and automating parts of development work. On \{W7X\} progress has been made during the last years in exploiting the benefit of automation and management during software development:â€“ Continuous build, integration and automated test of software artefacts.âˆ˜ Syntax checks and code quality metrics. âˆ˜ Documentation generation. âˆ˜ Feedback for developers by temporal statistics. â€“ Versioned repository for build products (libraries, executables). â€“ Separate snapshot and release repositories and automatic deployment. â€“ Semi-automatic provisioning of applications. â€“ Feedback from testers and feature requests by ticket system. This toolset is working efficiently and allows the team to concentrate on development. The activity there is presently focused on increasing the quality of the existing software to become a dependable product. Testing of single functions and qualities must be simplified. So a restructuring is underway which relies more on small, individually testable components with standardized interfaces providing the capability to construct arbitrary function aggregates for dedicated tests of quality attributes as availability, reliability, performance. A further activity is on improving the development cycle. The use of release cycles has already provided favourable concentration of work and predictability of delivery times. However, the demand has risen, to react quickly on priority changes from W7X-project management. So a more agile development cycle is being prepared relying on smaller working packages, shorter release cycles and an associated release plan giving the software development responsible the possibility to react on a shorter time scale."

The throughput goal of each iteration is estimated in story point format based on projected load factor, planned work days, and staff plan. The development team is responsible for achieving the target throughput goal of each iteration. Though pricing bid this way gains client trust quickly, key lesions are learnt and advice are given specifically on estimation, load factor projection, and client education."

Project management can play a significant role in facilitating this contribution, but \{SMEs\} require less bureaucratic forms of project management than those used by larger, traditional organizations. We are undertaking this research to identify the nature of project management required by SMEs, and the results of the qualitative stage of our research are reported in this paper. We interviewed people from companies of the three sizes of SME, micro, small and medium, from a range of industries and from four countries. \{SMEs\} use project management both to manage operations, to deliver tailored or bespoke products to customers, and manage innovation and growth. We found similar project management approaches used for both purposes. The main differences occurred by size of company and country. Both Ireland and Sweden looked for more laissez-faire management styles, while people in Austria and Romania were willing to accept more autocratic styles. People in Sweden wanted more structure than people in Ireland. Also laissez-faire styles of management were more appropriate in micro and small companies, whereas more democratic or autocratic styles were needed in medium-sized companies. All three sizes of company wanted less bureaucratic versions of project management than traditional forms, but medium-sized companies, where people fulfil more specialist roles, need more structure than small and micro companies."

This process has exhibited a remarkable growth in business interest over the last 15 years, as demonstrated by a 1000% increase in membership in the Project Management Institute since 1996. This growth is largely attributable to the emergence of many new diverse business applications that can be successfully managed as projects. The new applications for project management include IT implementations, research and development, new product and service development, corporate change management, and software development. The characteristics of modern projects are typically very different from those of traditional projects such as construction and engineering, which necessitates the development of new project management techniques. We discuss these recent practical developments. The history of project management methodology is reviewed, from CPM and PERT to the influential modern directions of critical chain project management and agile methods. We identify one important application area for future methodological change as new product and service development. A list of specific research topics within project management is discussed. The conclusions suggest the existence of significant research opportunities within project management."
1963.0,Excluded,ec3,Project scheduling conflict identification and resolution using genetic algorithms (GA),"Project management has gained a lot of application in software development activity in the past two decades. It is now considered to be one of the most critical component of software development lifecycle. Project management is traditionally defined as the discipline of planning, organizing, and managing activities and resources for successful execution and completion of project goals and objectives. In this respect, project management holds a key position in satisfactory completion of projects. That is the reason that we have a complete knowledge domain we know as software project management (SPM). The main purpose of SPM is to achieve all the project goals and objectives while working within the constraints posed by project environment and stakeholders. These constraints include (but not limited to) time, scope, resources, resource allocation and optimization etc. Successful project planning involved careful selection and synchronization of resources in order to achieve satisfactory completion of projects. These resources include human resource, rime, infrastructure etc. While planning software projects, it is natural to be confronted with various conflicts in resource allocation. It becomes a very time consuming activity to identify and sort out these conflicts when project size is large and time constraints are severe. A good project management activity is one which can effectively foresee these conflicts and resolve them in an optimal fashion. Computationally intelligent techniques are a good candidate to be used for the purpose of automation of this task. In this paper, a genetic algorithm based technique for conflict identification and resolution for project activities has been proposed. The effectiveness and utility of such a technique has also been discussed in this paper. The technique has been subjected to extensive experimentation and results have been presented."
1964.0,Excluded,ec3,Proposing Regulatory-Driven Automated Test Suites,"In regulated domains such as finance and health care, failure to comply with regulation can lead to financial, civil and criminal penalties. While systems vary from organization to organization, the same regulations apply for all systems. As a result, efficiencies could be gained if the commonalities between systems could be captured in public, shared, test suites for regulations. We propose the use of Behavior-Driven-Development (BDD) technology to create these test suites. With BDD, desired system behavior with respect to regulatory requirements can be captured as constrained natural language 'scenarios'. The scenarios can then be automated through system-specific test drivers. The goal of this research is to enable organizations to compare their systems to regulation in a repeatable and traceable way through the use of BDD. To evaluate our approach, we developed seven scenarios based on the HITECH Act Meaningful Use (MU) regulations for healthcare. We then created system-specific code for three open-source electronic health record systems. We found that it was possible to create scenarios and system-specific code supporting scenario execution on three systems, that iTrust can be shown to be noncompliant, and that emergency access procedures are not defined clearly enough by the regulation to determine compliance or non-compliance."

It not only established serious competition for many commercial software vendors, it also led to the availability of millions of source code artifacts on the Internet. For the time being there exists a fledgling community working on software search solutions and associated recommendation engines. However, the potential for reusing knowledge contained in internet-scale software repositories is far from being exhausted. While existing systems are limited to retrieving existing artifacts during the coding phase, in this position paper we propose a novel idea for determining the ""intersection"" of multiple similar artifacts that allows creating design recommendations for a developer even earlier in the development lifecycle."
1966.0,Excluded,ec7,Prototype system for pursuing firm’s core capability,"Core capabilities are critical abilities that enhance and sustain an organization’s competitive advantage in extremely competitive environments. In today’s complex and dynamic business environment, companies are often prevented from effectively and efficiently evaluating relevant factors necessary for developing their core capability strategic systems. These systems, with inherent human decision-making processes, should be fully considered when creating a method for determining a firm’s suitable or required core capabilities. It is helpful to implement IT-based group decision support systems (GDSS) with soft computing algorithms to assist managers in determining the appropriate core capabilities for the firm. Therefore, this study develops a holistic group decision support system in which similarity measures, fuzzy set theory, and fuzzy mathematics programming are implemented to facilitate managers in making decisions. Through evaluations done in actual cases, we have found that this system creates a flexible and user-friendly environment that aids top management and other relevant staff members in evaluating all relevant factors related to core capabilities."
1967.0,Excluded,ec3,Provenance-based validation of e-science experiments,"E-science experiments typically involve many distributed services maintained by different organisations. After an experiment has been executed, it is useful for a scientist to verify that the execution was performed correctly or is compatible with some existing experimental criteria or standards, not necessarily anticipated prior to execution. Scientists may also want to review and verify experiments performed by their colleagues. There are no existing frameworks for validating such experiments in today's e-science systems. Users therefore have to rely on error checking performed by the services, or adopt other ad hoc methods. This paper introduces a platform-independent framework for validating workflow executions. The validation relies on reasoning over the documented provenance of experiment results and semantic descriptions of services advertised in a registry. This validation process ensures experiments are performed correctly, and thus results generated are meaningful. The framework is tested in a bioinformatics application that performs protein compressibility analysis."
1968.0,Excluded,ec7,Pseudo software: A mediating instrument for modeling software requirements,"A new synthesis of software requirements models called pseudo software is proposed with the aim to cut requirements-related errors. Pseudo software achieves this aim by serving as a mediating instrument to empower stakeholders to participate in requirements elicitation and validation through model construction and manipulation, and to provide guidance to the development team to correctly interpret the requirements in the downstream development activities. Pseudo software obtains its traits as a mediating instrument through the choice of requirements information bits and the use of multimodal representations with tool support to integrate the requirements. Using historical data of fifty projects in the enterprise computing domain, pseudo software is shown to effectively cut the requirements-related errors committed by both the customer and the development team."

A trait is a set of methods which is completely independent from any class hierarchy and can be flexibly used to build other traits or classes by means of a suite of composition operations. We present: (i) a formulation of traits which aims to achieve complete compatibility and interoperability with the Java platform without reducing the flexibility of traits, and (ii) an integration with Eclipse which aims to support an incremental adoption of traits in existing Java projects. Indeed, the proposed trait language can coexist with Java code. Single parts of a project can be refactored to use traits, without requiring a complete rewrite of the whole existing code-base."

1972.0,Included,included,Quality Attribute Driven Agile Development,"Agile development methods are being recognized as popular and efficient approaches to the development of software systems that have features such as a short delivery period and unclear requirements. They emphasize customer satisfaction, fast response to changes, and release in less time. According to a recent survey, SCRUM is one of the most popular methods that are currently being used. Some backlogs, especially high priority backlogs that are functional requirements of customers, are developed repeatedly at each sprint period. Despite the known advantages of SCRUM, however, its backlogs focus only on functional features. Thus, it is difficult to effectively reflect the softwares quality attributes. As known, the failure of a software project is caused by the non-satisfaction not of functional features but of quality attributes, such as performance, usability, and reliability. This paper introduces the ACRUM that is a quality attribute driven agile development method. The main characteristic of the proposed solution is that it is derived from values and practices of SCRUM to be compatible with the SCRUM process and to keep its agility intact. The effect of ACRUM was evaluated through an agile process evaluation checklist and applying it into a commercial project of Samsung Electronics. The results showed that ACRUM is more efficient than the legacy agile development process."
1974.0,Excluded,ec3,Quality evaluation for Model-Driven Web Engineering methodologies,"Context There are lots of approaches or methodologies in the Model-Driven Web Engineering (MDWE) context to develop Web Applications without reaching a consensus on the use of standards and scarcity of both, practical experience and tool support. Objective Model-Driven Web Engineering (MDWE) methodologies are constantly evolving. Moreover, Quality is a very important factor to identify within a methodology as it defines processes, techniques and artifacts to develop Web Applications. For this reason, when analyzing a methodology, it is not only necessary to evaluate quality, but also to find out how to improve it. The main goal of this paper is to develop a set of Quality Characteristics and Sub-Characteristics for \{MDWE\} approaches based on ISO/IEC standards. Method From the software products context, some widely standards proposed, such as ISO/IEC 9126 or ISO/IEC 25000, suggest a Quality Model for software products, although up to now, there are no standard methods to assess quality on \{MDWE\} methodologies. Such methodologies can be organized into Properties, thus, a methodology has artifacts, processes and techniques. Then, each item is evaluated through a set of appropriate Quality Characteristics, depending on its nature. This paper proposes to evaluate a methodology as a product itself. Results This paper recommends a set of Quality Characteristics and Sub-Characteristics based on these standards in order to evaluate \{MDWE\} methodologies quality. Additionally, it defines an agile way to relate these Quality Sub-Characteristics to Properties with the sole purpose of not only analyzing, but also assessing and improving \{MDWE\} methodologies. Conclusions The application of these Quality Characteristics and Sub-Characteristics could promote efficiency in methodologies since this kind of assessment enhances both the understanding of strengths and weaknesses of approaches."
1975.0,Excluded,ec3,Quality factors for dynamic evolution in composition-based distributed applications,"Dynamic evolution is a phenomenon by which applications can be upgraded without shutdown and restart. This capability improves service levels while minimising the loss of business revenue and is particularly important for a variety of mission critical distributed applications running around the clock. While quality plays an important role in information systems and their development, little attention has been paid in the literature to quality in dynamic evolution. This paper proposes a set of quality factors for dynamic evolution suitable for composition-based (e.g. service-oriented and component-based) distributed application development using a multi-step process for their incremental development and evaluation. An initial set of factors was developed from the relevant literature. This set of factors was evaluated for their perceived importance and extended by a web survey of experienced practitioners and researchers. A review of twelve relevant development methodologies was then conducted to further extend the revised set. The proposed set of factors can provide guidance for practitioners and researchers in developing, managing and/or testing distributed applications which can benefit from dynamic evolution. To demonstrate a use of the quality factors, an assessment was performed on the twelve methodologies to evaluate their extent of support for the extended set of quality factors, with results summarising their strengths and areas for improvement to support dynamic evolution."
1976.0,Excluded,ec3,Quality of Testing in Test Driven Development,"Test-driven development is an essential part of Extreme Programming approach with the preference of being followed in other Agile methods as well. For several years, researchers are performing empirical investigations to evaluate quality improvements in the resulting code when test-driven development is being used. However, very little had been reported into investigating the quality of the testing performed in conjunction with test-driven development. In this paper we present results from an experiment specifically designed to evaluate the quality of test cases created by developers who used the test-first and the traditional test-last approaches. On an average, the quality of testing in test-driven development was almost the same as the quality of testing using test-last approach. However, detailed analysis of test cases, created by test-driven development group, revealed that 29% of test cases were ""negative"" test cases (based on non-specified requirements) but contributing as much as 65% to the overall tests quality score of test-first developers. We are currently investigating the possibility of extending test driven development to facilitate non-specified requirements to a higher extent and thus minimise the impact of a potentially inherent effect of positive test bias."

1979.0,Included,included,Quantified extreme scenario based design approach,"Over the past few years, agile methods have recorded impressive results in the software engineering field basically in terms of business value and time to market. Similarly, software usability has been the major success factor for interactive systems. Agile usability engineering has been motivated as a booming solution to develop better usability in a cost-effective manner. eXtreme Scenario Based Design (XSBD) is one of the effective agile usability approaches. However, XSBD does not provide explicit metrics to quantify the software usability. In this paper, we propose the Quantified eXtreme Scenario Based Design (QXSBD) approach, which complements XSBD with a set of usability metrics collected from the agile architecture-centric approach and the Quality in Use Integrated Model (QUIM). Further, QXSBD specifies the subset of usability metrics that need to be assessed at the major milestones in agile process. This integration employs the Usability Critical Parameters Workshop (UCPW) to provide engineering practices defining the usability requirements and design goals. We demonstrate the QXSBD, process through customer request project case study. The obtained results have shown that usability issues have been reduced by about 30%. Noticeable end user satisfaction has been achieved while maintaining the project total cost."
1980.0,Excluded,ec7,Quantifying requirements volatility effects,"In an organization operating in the bancassurance sector we identified a low-risk \{IT\} subportfolio of 84 \{IT\} projects comprising together 16,500 function points, each project varying in size and duration, for which we were able to quantify its requirements volatility. This representative portfolio stems from a much larger portfolio of \{IT\} projects. We calculated the volatility from the function point countings that were available to us. These figures were aggregated into a requirements volatility benchmark. We found that maximum requirements volatility rates depend on size and duration, which refutes currently known industrial averages. For instance, a monthly growth rate of 5% is considered a critical failure factor, but in our low-risk portfolio we found more than 21% of successful projects with a volatility larger than 5%. We proposed a mathematical model taking size and duration into account that provides a maximum healthy volatility rate that is more in line with the reality of low-risk \{IT\} portfolios. Based on the model, we proposed a tolerance factor expressing the maximal volatility tolerance for a project or portfolio. For a low-risk portfolio its empirically found tolerance is apparently acceptable, and values exceeding this tolerance are used to trigger \{IT\} decision makers. We derived two volatility ratios from this model, the Ï€ -ratio and the Ï� -ratio. These ratios express how close the volatility of a project has approached the danger zone when requirements volatility reaches a critical failure rate. The volatility data of a governmental \{IT\} portfolio were juxtaposed to our bancassurance benchmark, immediately exposing a problematic project, which was corroborated by its actual failure. When function points are less common, e.g.Â in the embedded industry, we used daily source code size measures and illustrated how to govern the volatility of a software product line of a hardware manufacturer. With the three real-world portfolios we illustrated that our results serve the purpose of an early warning system for projects that are bound to fail due to excessive volatility. Moreover, we developed essential requirements volatility metrics that belong on an \{IT\} governance dashboard and presented such a volatility dashboard."

By addressing the important issue of dealing with continuously changing requirements we are faced with panoply of new problems and a genuine need to revisit some principles and classic models of software developments. When it comes to the management of software projects and a way in which we are looking at the software processes and underlying practices, it becomes apparent that in the management practices the issue of uncertainty needs to be quantified and fully addressed. Similarly, it becomes of interest to develop lightweight models of software quality and software processes that are easy to construct and modify as well are transparent to the developer and manager. Given these arguments, in this study we propose logic models based upon the mechanisms of multivalued and fuzzy logic. The realization of such models gives rise to so-called logic networks that are easy to construct, calibrate and interpret."

It has been well known for its defect reduction capability. But, software can be made more reliable by means of process improvement. In general, models like CMM/CMMI have been used for software development process improvement. However, these models have some problems to be used with XP because of less number of process artifacts produced by agile processes. Six sigma on the other hand, provides the quantitative analysis capabilities required to measure and control process performance. Using XP with six sigma can provide means of analyzing XP data and systematically improve process performance. In order to prove our point, we map six sigma tools to activities involved at each phase of XP and show that six sigma technique can be used with XP to measure and improve the performance of XP process. We also suggest a six sigma process improvement guideline with examples."

The customer representative is constantly under pressure and may experience difficulties in foreseeing the adequacy of a release plan. Objective To assist release planning in \{XP\} by structuring the planning problem and providing an optimization model that suggests a suitable release plan. Method We develop an optimization model that generates a release plan taking into account story size, business value, possible precedence relations, themes, and uncertainty in velocity prediction. The running-time feasibility is established through computational tests. In addition, we provide a practical heuristic approach to velocity estimation. Results Computational tests show that problems with up to six themes and 50 stories can be solved exactly. An example provides insight into uncertainties affecting velocity, and indicates that the model can be applied in practice. Conclusion An optimization model can be used in practice to enable the customer representative to take more informed decisions faster. This can help adopting \{XP\} in projects where plan-driven approaches have traditionally been used."

Many requirements engineering (RE) methods demand user-participation, clear functional objectives and a well defined context of use. These demands are hard to meet in the healthcare domain, which is characterized by high diversity, complexity and little time and money to spend. There are many examples of healthcare software systems that have failed due to lacking investment in the early phases of design and requirements analysis. We have developed methods for gathering detailed observational data about care and communication practice. In this article, we explain how this data can be used for iterative, demand-driven, requirements elicitation and to answer design questions. The examples are taken from structured observation of actors, situations, information usage and activities at two Norwegian hospitals. We regard this approach as a useful supplement to other RE methods, in particular for agile development methods."

Remaining conversant with all components in such a repository presents a significant challenge to developers. Indeed the retrieval of a particular component in this large search space may prove problematic. Further to this, the reuse of components developed in an Agile environment is likely to be hampered by the existence of little or no support materials. We propose to infer the need for a component and proactively recommend that component to the developer using a technique which is consistent with the principles of Agile methodologies. Our RASCAL recommender agent tracks usage histories of a group of developers to recommend to an individual developer components that are expected to be needed by that developer. Unlike many traditional recommender systems, we may recommend items that the developer has actually employed previously. We introduce a content-based filtering technique for ordering the set of recommended software components and present a comparative analysis of applying this technique to a number of collaborative filtering algorithms. We also investigate the relationship between the number of usage histories collected and recommendation accuracy.

Test-driven development has recently re-emerged as a critical enabling practice of agile software development methodologies. However, little empirical evidence supports or refutes the utility of this practice in an industrial context. Case studies were conducted with three development teams at Microsoft and one at IBM that have adopted TDD. The results of the case studies indicate that the pre-release defect density of the four products decreased between 40% and 90% relative to similar projects that did not use the TDD practice.

It combines the benefits of inverse dynamics optimization method and receding horizon optimal control technique. Firstly, the ground attack trajectory planning problem is mathematically formulated as a receding horizon optimal control problem (RHC-OCP). In particular, an approximate elliptic launch acceptable region (LAR) model is proposed to model the critical weapon delivery constraints. Secondly, a planning algorithm based on inverse dynamics optimization, which has high computational efficiency and good convergence properties, is developed to solve the RHC-OCP in real-time. Thirdly, in order to improve robustness and adaptivity in a dynamic and uncertain environment, a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) receding horizon control architecture is introduced and a regular real-time update strategy is proposed as well, and the real-time feedback can be achieved and the not-converged situations can be handled. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the efficiency of this framework, and the results also show that the presented technique is well suited for real-time implementation in dynamic and uncertain environment."

In particular, we focus on requirements expressed in a probabilistic manner, such as reliability or performance. We illustrate a unified approach-a method and its support tools-which facilitates reasoning about requirements satisfaction as the system evolves dynamically. The approach relies on run-time monitoring and uses the data collected by the probes to detect if the behavior of the open environment in which the application is situated, such as usage profile or the external services currently bound to the application, deviates from the initially stated assumptions and whether this can lead to a failure of the application. This is achieved by keeping a model of the application alive at run time, automatically updating its parameters to reflect changes in the external world, and using the model's predictive capabilities to anticipate future failures, thus enabling suitable recovery plans."

Reconciling Perspectives is a four-stage process to drive the convergence of the different points of view or perspectives individuals have of a software project. What this theory reveals is the importance of individuals' ability to reach out and engage in negotiations to the success of a software project."
2007.0,Excluded,ec7,Reconciling Requirements and Architectures with the CBSP Approach in an iPhone App Project," There are only few methods available that help refining software requirements to software architectures. An example is the CBSP (Component-Bus-System-Property) approach that uses general architectural concerns to classify and refine requirements and to capture architectural trade-off issues and options. This paper reports about experiences of applying CBSP in an industrial project in the area of mobile applications. We illustrate CBSP using project examples. We discuss how the approach was tailored and present extensions we developed. In particular, we show how CBSP can be used together with the Goal-Question-Metric approach to guide architectural decisions. We close our paper with a discussion of lessons learned during this project."
2008.0,Excluded,ec3,Reconciling software development models: A quasi-systematic review,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to characterize reconciliation among the plan-driven, agile, and free/open source software models of software development. Design/methodology/approach An automated quasi-systematic review identified 42 papers, which were then analyzed. Findings The main findings are: there exist distinct â€“ organization, group and process â€“ levels of reconciliation; few studies deal with reconciliation among the three models of development; a significant amount of work addresses reconciliation between plan-driven and agile development; several large organizations (such as Microsoft, Motorola, and Philips) are interested in trying to combine these models; and reconciliation among software development models is still an open issue, since it is an emerging area and research on most proposals is at an early stage. Research limitations Automated searches may not capture relevant papers in publications that are not indexed. Other data sources not amenable to execution of the protocol were not used. Data extraction was performed by only one researcher, which may increase the risk of threats to internal validity. Implications This characterization is important for practitioners wanting to be current with the state of research. This review will also assist the scientific community working with software development processes to build a common understanding of the challenges that must be faced, and to identify areas where research is lacking. Finally, the results will be useful to software industry that is calling for solutions in this area. Originality/value There is no other systematic review on this subject, and reconciliation among software development models is an emerging area. This study helps to identify and consolidate the work done so far and to guide future research. The conclusions are an important step towards expanding the body of knowledge in the field."
2009.0,Excluded,ec3,Recovering test-to-code traceability using slicing and textual analysis,"Abstract Test suites are a valuable source of up-to-date documentation as developers continuously modify them to reflect changes in the production code and preserve an effective regression suite. While maintaining traceability links between unit test and the classes under test can be useful to selectively retest code after a change, the value of having traceability links goes far beyond this potential savings. One key use is to help developers better comprehend the dependencies between tests and classes and help maintain consistency during refactoring. Despite its importance, test-to-code traceability is not common in software development and, when needed, traceability information has to be recovered during software development and evolution. We propose an advanced approach, named SCOTCH+ (Source code and \{COncept\} based Test to Code traceability Hunter), to support the developer during the identification of links between unit tests and tested classes. Given a test class, represented by a \{JUnit\} class, the approach first exploits dynamic slicing to identify a set of candidate tested classes. Then, external and internal textual information associated with the classes retrieved by slicing is analyzed to refine this set of classes and identify the final set of candidate tested classes. The external information is derived from the analysis of the class name, while internal information is derived from identifiers and comments. The approach is evaluated on five software systems. The results indicate that the accuracy of the proposed approach far exceeds the leading techniques found in the literature."
2010.0,Excluded,ec7,Recovering the emergent logic in a software design exercise,"This paper develops a deeper understanding of professional software design by examining the emergent logic of a software design exercise. Decision-making is evident as a â€˜productâ€™ of activity, including coordinated attention to primarily two artefacts, the brief and the whiteboard. Thus, we pay attention to the â€˜situatednessâ€™ of decision-making, which is not one personâ€™s accomplishment, but is interactively carried out through treating what is known to the participants such as requirements written in the brief as â€˜documentaryâ€™ of what is to be understood. The paper examines how each pair resolved the requirements uncertainties, by treating different â€˜usersâ€™ differently. Our examination reveals how different approaches to the design exercise were actually organised to shed new light on software design practices."
2011.0,Excluded,ec7,Reducing complexity using an interaction room: an experience report,"Large-scale information system evolution projects often place high demands on both business and technical stakeholders' cognitive and communication skills. Especially if the need for evolution is not confined to a particular feature, but affects the whole value chain, finding dependencies and interrelationships between processes and components is challenging as it requires cross-departmental understanding. These issues can be even more challenging for management stakeholders who need to make high-level and far-reaching decisions on implementation strategies despite not being deeply involved in the technical details. One of the main problems in such projects is that the stakeholders who have expert knowledge typically have only little methodical experience, while the method experts lack the business experience. In this paper, we report on experiences and lessons from a large systems evolution project in a German insurance company, where we applied a new approach -- the so-called ""Interaction Room"" -- to improve stakeholders' understanding of the project's risks and dependencies in a pragmatic way, without overwhelming them with a heavyweight analysis method."
2012.0,Excluded,ec3,Reducing test cost and improving documentation in TDD (Test Driven Development),"In the fast pace business world of today where competition and technology are at their zenith, software development companies need to improve their quality standards in addition to cost reduction in operations. To achieve these challenging objectives various developments are on the verge. In recent past agile methodologies have emerged as one of the most efficient implementations in the world of software development arena. Especially eXtreme programming (XP) which is integrated by Test first approach recent research proves the emergence of Test Driven Development (TDD) from this concept which is based on formalizing the requirement as a test and secondly to write such a code that can pass the test. This attempt of our research provides a mechanism to reduce the cost of testing, mainly due to troublesome test which fails again and again. We used TDD, analyzed the problem and proposed a workable solution. Test Driven Development is a technique which encourages less documentation resulting in a lot of difficulties for developers in contrast to traditional methods. In order to reduce the burden on developers we have proposed some steps in documentation. Â© 2006 IEEE."
2013.0,Excluded,ec3,Refactoring as a Lifeline: Lessons Learned from Refactoring,"Refactoring legacy code can be a major impediment for teams transforming to agile due to the high cost of manual regression testing of frequent (typically 2-week) releases. Also, attempts to implement automated tests may involve technical and cost issues. In this report we present a new and more systematic approach to refactoring we have found to be successful for refactoring legacy code that has few (if any) automated tests. This report describes two experiences: one with 3 teams applying a basic and traditional refactoring approach, and another with 2 teams applying the new approach. This new approach helped achieve better results in covering code with tests, involved senior management to retain their support, and achieved better and more sustainable pace of development powered by continuous refactoring techniques."
2014.0,Excluded,ec3,Refactoring large process model repositories,"With the increasing adoption of process-aware information systems, large process model repositories have emerged. Typically, the models in such repositories are re-aligned to real-world events and demands through adaptation on a day-to-day basis. This bears the risk of introducing model redundancies and of unnecessarily increasing model complexity. If no continuous investment is made in keeping process models simple, changes will become more difficult and error-prone over time. Although refactoring techniques are widely used in software engineering to address similar problems, so far, no comparable state-of-the-art has evolved in the business process management domain. Process designers either have to refactor process models by hand or are simply unable to apply respective techniques at all. This paper proposes a catalogue of process model â€œsmellsâ€� for identifying refactoring opportunities. In addition, it introduces a set of behavior-preserving techniques for refactoring large process repositories. The proposed refactorings enable process designers to effectively deal with model complexity by making process models better understandable and easier to maintain. The refactorings have been evaluated using large process repositories from the healthcare and automotive domain. To demonstrate the feasibility of the refactoring techniques, a proof-of-concept prototype has been implemented."

2016.0,Excluded,ec7,Refactoring OCL annotated UML class diagrams,"Refactoring of UML class diagrams is an emerging research topic and heavily inspired by refactoring of program code written in object-oriented implementation languages. Current class diagram refactoring techniques concentrate on the diagrammatic part but neglect OCL constraints that might become syntactically incorrect by changing the underlying class diagram. This paper formalizes the most important refactoring rules for class diagrams and classifies them with respect to their impact on attached OCL constraints. For refactoring rules that have an impact on OCL constraints, we formalize the necessary changes of the attached constraints. Our refactoring rules are specified in a graph-grammar inspired formalism. They have been implemented as QVT transformation rules. We finally discuss for our refactoring rules the problem of syntax preservation and show, by using the KeY-system, how this can be resolved."
2017.0,Excluded,ec3,Refactoring support for Smalltalk using static type inference,"Refactoring is a crucial activity in agile software development. As a consequence, automated tools are expected to support refactoring, both for reducing the developer's effort as well as for avoiding errors due to manual changes. In this context, the chosen programming language has a major impact on the level of support that an automated refactoring tool can offer. One important aspect of a programming language concerning the automation of refactoring is the type system. While a static type system, present in languages such as Java, provides information about dependencies in the program, the dynamic type system of the Smalltalk programming language offers little information that can be used by automated refactoring tools. This paper focuses on the challenges in the context of refactoring raised by the dynamic type system of Smalltalk. It highlights the problems caused by the absence of static type information and proposes the use of static code analysis for performing type inference to gather information about the dependencies in the program's source code. It explains the mechanism of the static code analysis using sample code and presents a prototype of an enhanced refactoring tool, which uses the structural information extracted through static code analysis. Empirical samples build the base for evaluating the effectiveness of the approach."
2022.0,Excluded,ec4,"Reference architecture, metamodel, and modeling principles for architectural knowledge management in information technology services","Capturing and sharing design knowledge such as architectural decisions is becoming increasingly important in firms providing professional Information Technology (IT) services such as enterprise application development and strategic outsourcing. Methods, models, and tools supporting explicit knowledge management strategies have been proposed in recent years; however, several challenges remain unaddressed. In this paper, we extend our previous work to overcome these challenges and to satisfy the requirements of an additional user group, presales architects that are responsible for \{IT\} service solution proposals. In strategic outsourcing, such solution proposals require complex, contractually relevant design decisions concerning many different resources such as \{IT\} infrastructures, people, and real estate. To support both presales and project architects, we define a common reference architecture and a decision process-oriented metamodel. We also present a tool implementation of these concepts and discuss their application to outsourcing proposals and application development projects. Finally, we establish twelve decision modeling principles and practices that capture the practical experience gained and lessons learned during the application of our decision modeling concepts to both proposal development and architecture design work on projects."
2029.0,Excluded,ec3,ReFit: A Fit test maintenance plug-in for the Eclipse refactoring plug-in,"The Fit framework is a widely established tool for automated acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). Fit stores the test specification separate from the test fixture code in an easily human readable and editable tabular form in HTML format. Additional tools like the FitPro plugin or FitN esse support the writing of test specifications and test fixtures from within the Eclipse IDE or the Web. With the increasing popularity of agile test-driven software development, maintenance of the evolving and growing test base has become an important issue. However, there has been no support yet for automated refactoring of Fit test cases. In a recent research project, we developed the Eclipse plugin ReFit for automated refactoring of Fit test cases. Fit test refactoring can occur due to changing requirements or changing Java code, which in either case means a cross-language refactoring to keep test specification and test fixture in sync. In this paper the concept for the development of the ReFit Eclipse Plugin is described, which significantly reduces the effort for Fit test maintenance and makes refactoring less error prone. Besides a tight integration into the existing Eclipse refactoring plugin, major goals of the plugin were to make it easy extensible for additional refactorings, new fixture types and further test specification file formats. Challenges faced when adding new and modifying existing Eclipse refactoring behavior are described and are due to the strong dependency on the Eclipse JDK and LTK features, and the solutions developed are presented."
2031.0,Excluded,ec6,Reflections on 10 years of sponsored senior design projects: Students winâ€“clients win!,"Undergraduate computer science degree programs often provide an opportunity for students to experience real software projects as a part of their programs of study. These experiences frequently reside in a course in which students form software development teams, are assigned to a project offered by a corporate sponsor and devote one or two semesters to the task of making progress on the project. In an ideal model, faculty mentor student teams who, in turn, behave as subcontractors or consultants to the sponsor. Students work for a grade, not directly for the sponsor as a true subcontractor would. In the ideal model, students demonstrate what they have learned about software engineering process, as well as their ability to implement programmed solutions. Student teams provide progress reports, both oral and written, and directly experience many of the challenges and successes of true software engineering professionals. This paper reports on one such program after 10 years of operation. The technologies and software development processes of student projects are summarized and presented as an informal survey. Student response is discussed in terms of software systems they produced and how they went about producing them. The maturation of these students as software engineering professionals is also discussed."

The problems and their solutions typically require a combination of technology and social policy."
2033.0,Excluded,ec7,Reflective design of technology for human needs,"Inspired by an economic interpretation of the Faustus drama allegorically disclosing the ‘alchemical’ nature of modern economy, the paper presents a critical view on the development of technology as concomitant phenomenon of work practices with particular focus on manufacturing. It starts with a theoretical perspective on the dynamics of creating explicit propositional knowledge and its re-appropriation for practical use. This lays the ground for understanding how technical artefacts emerge from and, in turn, affect social practices. It further helps to understand the development of human reflective action competence and working capacity as most relevant forces of production in complex and dynamic market environments. These relationships are exemplified in some detail by looking at the problematic development and use of IT in manufacturing’s value creating processes. The paper finally advocates reflective attitudes and evolutionary procedures as basic principles for designing useful and useable IT systems according to human needs and for protecting oneself from the Faustian omnipotence delusion of endless and effortless wealth creation."
2034.0,Excluded,ec3,Re-founding software engineering – SEMAT at the age of three (keynote abstract),"Software engineering is gravely hampered by immature practices. Specific problems include: The prevalence of fads more typical of the fashion industry than an engineering discipline; a huge number of methods and method variants, with differences little understood and artificially magnified; the lack of credible experimental evaluation and validation; and the split between industry practice and academic research. At the root of the problems we lack a sound, widely accepted theoretical basis. A prime example of such a basis is Maxwell’s equations in electrical engineering. It is difficult to fathom what electrical engineering would be today without those four concise equations. They are a great example to the statement “There is nothing so practical as a good theory”. In software engineering we have nothing similar, and there is widespread doubt whether it is needed. This talk will argue for the need of a basic theory in software engineering, a theory identifying its pure essence, its common ground or its kernel. The Semat (Software Engineering Methods and Theory) community addresses this huge challenge. It supports a process to refound software engineering based on a kernel of widely-agreed elements, extensible for specific uses, addressing both technology and people issues. This kernel represents the essence of software engineering. This talk promises to make you see the light in the tunnel."

Sc. programme in Information Technology (BIT) with a contextualised curriculum in 2007. Three years later we ran an exploratory research project to design, implement and evaluate a course in which an Android-based pervasive learning game was developed for a Tanzanian museum. Course participants were students from Tumaini University and from a Finnish university. A case study of the pervasive game development process and related evaluation show how a real-world pervasive game development project fits to a contextualised curriculum, and what are the effects of an international multidisciplinary team to the learning experiences. The results indicate that the students developed skills related to technology, design, collaboration, communication, data collection and analysis, language and project work. The course also kindled the students' interest towards mobile games, Android, programming, traveling and other cultures. The results include also a set of learned lessons which may be useful for educators planning to implement similar courses as part of a contextualised curriculum."
2037.0,Excluded,ec7,Relating problem oriented engineering to current development processes: a research agenda,"In this position paper, we propose research into expressing software development processes in terms of one generic theory, namely Problem Oriented Engineering (POE). Our aim is to relate the POE process to those available in the Rational Unified Process (RUP), and initially we will propose tentative mappings between RUP and POE entities. By doing it, we would investigate the feasibility of applying similar mapping methodology to other Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) processes. This approach should provide insights on whether (and how) RUP separates problems from solutions, and also how to enrich RUP with traceability and POE with concepts that cover state-of-practice. The research agenda we propose in this paper addresses the problem space in the state-of-practice: being the first research attempt to bind the POE process with the OOAD processes, it could be a further contribution to the foundation for normalising object-oriented enterprise systems. While the steps towards normal design in software engineering could be captured as problem frames, patterns and architectures, we extend these ideas further onto the software development processes, which might help close the gap between software engineering and normal design."
2038.0,Excluded,ec7,RELAX: Incorporating Uncertainty into the Specification of Self-Adaptive Systems,"Self-adaptive systems have the capability to autonomously modify their behaviour at run-time in response to changes in their environment. Self-adaptation is particularly necessary for applications that must run continuously, even under adverse conditions and changing requirements; sample domains include automotive systems, telecommunications, and environmental monitoring systems. While a few techniques have been developed to support the monitoring and analysis of requirements for adaptive systems, limited attention has been paid to the actual creation and specification of requirements of self-adaptive systems. As a result, self-adaptivity is often constructed in an ad-hoc manner. In this paper, we argue that a more rigorous treatment of requirements explicitly relating to self-adaptivity is needed and that, in particular, requirements languages for self-adaptive systems should include explicit constructs for specifying and dealing with the uncertainty inherent in self-adaptive systems. We present RELAX, a new requirements language for self-adaptive systems and illustrate it using examples from the smart home domain."
2039.0,Excluded,ec7,Release Pattern Discovery via Partitioning: Methodology and Case Study,"The development of Open Source systems produces a variety of software artifacts such as source code, version control records, bug reports, and email discussions. Since the development is distributed across different tool environments and developer practices, any analysis of project behavior must be inferred from whatever common artifacts happen to be available. In this paper, we propose an approach to characterizing a project's behavior around the time of major and minor releases; we do this by partitioning the observed activities, such as artifact check-ins, around the dates of major and minor releases, and then look for recognizable patterns. We validate this approach by means of a case study on the MySQL database system; in this case study, we found patterns which suggested MySQL was behaving consistently within itself. These patterns included testing and documenting that took place more before a release than after and that the rate of source code changes dipped around release time."

CMM has its origins in managing large software projects for the government and emphasizes achieving expected outcomes. In GQM, organizational goals are identified. The appropriate questions with corresponding measurements are defined and collected. Six Sigma has its origins in manufacturing and emphasizes reducing cost and defects. In DMAIC, a major component of a Six Sigma approach, sources of waste are identified. Then changes are made in the process to reduce effort and increase the quality of the product produced. GQM and Six Sigma are complementary. Both approaches rely heavily on the measurement of input and output metrics. Mining development artifacts can provide usable metrics for the application of DMAIC and GQM in the software domain."
2045.0,Excluded,ec3,Representing unit test data for large scale software development,"Large scale software projects rely on routine, automated testing to gauge progress towards its goals. The diversity and quantity of these tests grow as time and project scope increase. This is as a consequence of both experience and expanding audience. It becomes increasingly difficult to interpret testing results as the testing suites multiply and diversify. If interpretation becomes too difficult, testings results could become ignored all together. Visualization has proven to be an effective tool to aid the interpretation of large amounts of data. We have adapted visualization techniques based on small multiples to communicate the health of the software project across several levels of abstraction. The collective set of techniques we refer to as the SeeTest visualization schema. We applied this visualization technique to the Open MPI test results in order to assist developers in the software release cycle. Through the visualizations, developers found a variety of surprising mismatches between their data and their intuitions. This exploration did not involve collecting any data not already being collected, merely presenting it in manner that better supported their needs. In this paper, we detail the development of the representation we used and give more particular analysis of the insights gained by the Open MPI community. The techniques presented in this paper can be applied to other software projects."
2046.0,Excluded,ec3,Reputation-based self-management of software process artifact quality in consortium research projects,"This paper proposes a PhD research that deals with improving internal documentation in software projects. Software developers often do not like to create documentation because it has few value to the individual himself. Yet the purpose of internal documentation is to help others understand the software and the problem it addresses. Documentation increases development speed, reduces software maintenance costs, helps to keep development on track, and mitigates the negative effects of distance in distributed settings. This research aims to increase the individuals' motivation to write documentation by means of reputation. The CollabReview prototype is a web-based reputation system that analyzes artifacts of internal documentation to derive personal reputation scores. Developers making many good contributions will achieve higher reputation scores. These scores can then be employed to softly influence developer behavior, e.g. by incentivizing them to contribute to documentation with social rewards. No strict rule enforcement is necessary."
2047.0,Included,included,Requirement analysis in agile software development of distributed systems,"Agile methodologies (DSDM, XP, Crystal, SCRUM, etc.) have been adopted as popular approaches to software development mainly because of their capability to deliver the end product faster and incorporate changes to the requirements. Agile follows iterative development, i.e. the implementation of software systems in successive releases. A side effect of multiple releases is introducing inconsistencies to the requirements that may lead to unpredictability of the system behavior at the run-time. Unpredictable systems are hard to debug and harder to manage. It is believed that agile methods can benefit from using more quantified and yet light-weight approaches across the entire development life cycle and particularly, the analysis of requirements for correctness. Checking for consistency of requirements prior to their implementation can remove the predictability problem and lead to significant savings in time and maintenance cost. This research proposes the utilization of a software tool which employs methodologies to automatically analyze system requirements in agile development and detect inconsistencies. The portrayal of requirements via user stories in agile development is used for this purpose. The advantages of adding requirement analysis methodologies to agile development are illustrated using a case study of a real-time drilling simulator."
2048.0,Excluded,ec7,Requirements Analysis for a Product Family of DNA Nanodevices," DNA nanotechnology uses the information processing capabilities of nucleic acids to design self-assembling, programmable structures and devices at the nanoscale. Devices developed to date have been programmed to implement logic circuits and neural networks, capture or release specific molecules, and traverse molecular tracks and mazes. Here we investigate the use of requirements engineering methods to make DNA nanotechnology more productive, predictable, and safe. We use goal-oriented requirements modeling to identify, specify, and analyze a product family of DNA nanodevices, and we use PRISM model checking to verify both common properties across the family and properties that are specific to individual products. Challenges to doing requirements engineering in this domain include the error-prone nature of nanodevices carrying out their tasks in the probabilistic world of chemical kinetics, the fact that roughly a nanomole (a 1 followed by 14 0s) of devices are typically deployed at once, and the difficulty of specifying and achieving modularity in a realm where devices have many opportunities to interfere with each other. Nevertheless, our results show that requirements engineering is useful in DNA nanotechnology and that leveraging the similarities among nanodevices in the product family improves the modeling and analysis by supporting reuse."

This paper reports on findings from an explanatory case study aiming at a deeper understanding of the causes and effects of communication gaps in a large-scale industrial set up. Based on an assumption of what causes gaps in communication of requirements and what effects such gaps have, a semi-structured interview study was performed with nine practitioners at a large market-driven software company. We found four main factors that affect the requirements communication, namely scale, temporal aspects, common views and decision structures. The results also show that communication gaps lead to failure to meet the customers' expectations, quality issues and wasted effort. An increased awareness of these factors is a help in identifying what to address to achieve a more efficient requirements management, and ultimately more efficient and successful software development. By closing the communication gaps the requirements may continue all the way through the project life-cycle and be more likely to result in software that meets the customers' expectations."
2050.0,Excluded,ec7,Requirements attributes to predict requirements related defects,"Literature suggests that requirements defects are a very costly problem to fix. Understanding how requirements changes influence the overall quality of software is important. Having some defect predictors at the requirements stage may help the stakeholders avoid making choices that could bring about catastrophic defect numbers at the end or at least be prepared for it. In this paper, six requirements-related attributes are analyzed to discover if they can be used for determining the occurrences of requirements-related defects. We measured two types of attributes: point and aggregate. The point attributes include time estimates, priority and ownership. The aggregate attributes include the number of indirect stakeholders, the number of related stories and the story creation time. Our analysis is based on data from the development of the IBM Jazz system. Our result shows that the number of indirect stakeholders and the number of related stories are good predictors for the number of defects, but other attributes show no or little correlation with the defects."

2053.0,Excluded,ec7,Requirements Clinic: Third Party Inspection Methodology and Practice for Improving the Quality of Software Requirements Specifications," We have been involved in a number of large-scale software development projects, which might lead to loss of millions of dollars if failed. The quality of SRS (Software Requirements Specification) is the key to success of the software development. Review and inspection are common practices for the verification and validation of SRS. However, verification techniques used in projects might be characterized as ad hoc. In this article, we propose requirements clinic, a third party inspection methodology for improving the quality of the SRS. In order to systematically inspect a SRS, we developed a perspective-based inspection methodology based on PQM (Pragmatic Quality Model) of SRS. PQM is derived from IEEE Std. 830 from the perspective of pragmatic quality. To inspect a SRS according to PQM, we identified 198 inspection points, which lead to a quality score between 0 and 100. The requirements clinic advises to the requirements engineering team by a comprehensive quality inspection report including quality score, benchmark and SRS patterns for improvement. Since 2010, we have been practicing the methodology to a variety of development projects, and revealed an average of 10.6 ROI in 12 projects. We also discuss the feasibility of the methodology and lessons learned from the practices."
2054.0,Excluded,ec7,Requirements Composition Table Explained," Aspect-oriented requirements engineering (AORE) introduced an artifact called Requirements Composition Table (RCT). RCT presents a holistic view of an application's functionality structured by core features and crosscutting concerns. This artifact can effectively support various project tasks and serve as a common frame of reference for all parties on a project team. As AORE remains little-known to most practitioners in the software development field, the purpose of this paper is to explain the RCT concept to practitioners and discuss its benefits. The RCT technique has been implemented for a number of Wall Street applications at various investment banks. RCT can help us perform important project tasks and has proven to be one of the most valuable artifacts of a software project.

The paper describes also a model of the software lifecycle derived from a Michael Jackson quotation, a model that explains about 95% of the quotations that we gathered. In particular, it explains why basic requirements determination is unstoppable and how management attempts to stop RE lead to the phenomena that are described by the quotations and less than optimal requirements specifications."
2056.0,Excluded,ec7,Requirements Elicitation in a Telemedicine Pain-treatment Trial," This paper presents the early phase requirements elicitation for a work-related neck-shoulder pain teletreatment trial and the assessment of those requirements in respect of their importance to the trial and the feasibility of the needed software adaptations of the telemedicine system within the constraints of the project organizing the trial. The elicitation adopts specific solutions and constraints that are typical for working practices in medicine. In particular, the contribution of this paper is its holistic approach in addressing the intertwining of the requirements elicitation and the trial design. Trial design defines the trial settings and the treatment protocols in a standardized way such that treatment efficacy can be evaluated based on evidence. A cyclic approach which applies a set of elicitation techniques and informal specification styles (e.g. tables and mock-ups) is adopted in order to converge on a set of requirements understood and agreed upon also by the trial designers, who are medical professionals, often unaware of formal methods, and who co-shape the telemedicine system."
2057.0,Excluded,ec7,Requirements Elicitation: Towards the Unknown Unknowns," Requirements elicitation research is reviewed using a framework categorising the relative `knowness' of requirements specification and Common Ground discourse theory. The main contribution of this survey is to review requirements elicitation from the perspective of this framework and propose a road map of research to tackle outstanding elicitation problems involving tacit knowledge. Elicitation techniques (interviews, scenarios, prototypes, etc.) are investigated, followed by representations, models and support tools. The survey results suggest that elicitation techniques appear to be relatively mature, although new areas of creative requirements are emerging. Representations and models are also well established although there is potential for more sophisticated modelling of domain knowledge. While model-checking tools continue to become more elaborate, more growth is apparent in NL tools such as text mining and IR which help to categorize and disambiguate requirements. Social collaboration support is a relatively new area that facilitates categorisation, prioritisation and matching collections of requirements for product line versions. A road map for future requirements elicitation research is proposed investigating the prospects for techniques, models and tools in green-field domains where few solutions exist, contrasted with brown-field domains where collections of requirements and products already exist. The paper concludes with remarks on the possibility of elicitation tackling the most difficult question of `unknown unknown' requirements."
2058.0,Excluded,ec7,Requirements Engineering and Process Modelling in Software Quality Management— Towards a Generic Process Metamodel,"This paper examines the concept of Quality in Software Engineering, its different contexts and its different meanings to various people. It begins with a commentary on quality issues for systems development and various stakeholders' involvement. It revisits aspects and concepts of systems development methods and highlights the relevance of quality issues to the choice of a process model. A summarised review of some families of methods is presented, where their application domain, lifecycle coverage, strengths and weaknesses are considered. Under the new development era the requirements of software development change; the role of methods and stakeholders change, too. The paper refers to the latest developments in the area of software engineering and emphasises the shift from traditional conceptual modelling to requirements engineering and process metamodelling principles. We provide support for an emerging discipline in the form of a software process metamodel to cover new issues for software quality and process improvement. The widening of the horizons of software engineering both as a ‘communication tool’ and as a ‘scientific discipline’ (and not as a ‘craft’) is needed in order to support both communicative and scientific quality systems properties. In general, we can consider such a discipline as a thinking tool for understanding the generic process and as the origin of combining intuition and quality engineering to transform requirements to adequate human-centred information systems. We conclude with a schematic representation of a Generic Process Metamodel (GPM) indicating facets contributed by Software Engineering, Computer Science, Information Systems, Mathematics, Linguistics, Sociology and Anthropology. Ongoing research and development issues have provided evidence for influence from even more diverse disciplines."
2059.0,Excluded,ec7,Requirements engineering challenges in market-driven software development â€“ An interview study with practitioners,"Requirements engineering for market-driven software development entails special challenges. This paper presents results from an empirical study that investigates these challenges, taking a qualitative approach using interviews with fourteen employees at eight software companies and a focus group meeting with practitioners. The objective of the study is to increase the understanding of the area of market-driven requirements engineering and provide suggestions for future research by describing encountered challenges. A number of challenging issues were found, including bridging communication gaps between marketing and development, selecting the right level of process support, basing the release plan on uncertain estimates, and managing the constant flow of requirements."
2060.0,Excluded,ec7,Requirements Engineering for the Uganda Police Force Crime Records Management System," This paper presents the requirements engineering process for the Uganda Police Force Crime Records Management System. The system was envisioned to substantially improve the performance of the crime records management function of the Uganda Police Force through strengthening the pertinent processes. The requirements engineering process involved definition of the system context and goals, requirements elicitation, analysis and specification. The process was championed by the ARMS Project, Makerere University. Following the successful requirements engineering process, the ARMS Project together with the Uganda Police Force embarked on a two year project to design, construct and deploy the envisioned Crime Records Management System at selected police sites in Uganda. The key challenges faced during the requirements engineering process, such as changes in the composition of the Uganda Police Force project team, requirements traceability, and low representation of business process owners, are also presented."
2061.0,Excluded,ec7,Requirements engineering in health care: the example of chemotherapy planning in paediatric oncology,"Health care is characterized by highly complex processes of patient care that require unusual amount of communication between different health care professionals of different institutions. Sub-optimal processes can significantly impact on the patient’s health, increase the consumption of services and resources and in severe cases can lead to the patient death. For these reasons, requirements engineering for the development of information technology in health care is a complex process as well: without constant and rigorous evaluation, the impact of new systems on the quality of care is unknown and it is possible that badly designed systems significantly harm patients. To overcome these limitations, we present and discuss an approach to requirements engineering that we applied for the development of applications for chemotherapy planning in paediatric oncology. Chemotherapy planning in paediatric oncology is complex and time-consuming and errors must be avoided by all means. In the multi-hospital/multi-trial-centre environment of paediatric oncology, it is especially difficult and time-consuming to analyse requirements. Our approach combines a grounded theory approach with evolutionary prototyping based on the constant development and refinement of a generic domain model, in this case a domain model for chemotherapy planning in paediatric oncology. The prototypes were introduced in medical centres and final results show that the developed generic domain model is adequate."

Something must be done!"" But what? That's the million dollar question. A great start for fixing this long-standing software development crisis is with requirements; we must fully understand what we are developing before we can develop the right product for our customers. Readers will probably shake their head and say ""Of course we do"" but statistics show that even though this seems to be a ""no brainer"" we still aren't doing it."

2064.0,Included,included,Requirements in agile software development,"Nowadays, software organizations spend much time and resources to analyze and investigate software requirements. Thus some factors like the need to fast software delivery with a high quality, the superiority in competition with other companies, satisfying customers, considering the market dynamics, the change of customer needs, and addressing market challenges have finally led to develop agile methods as well as the requirements issue becomes one of the most important topics. As it is time consuming to define needs at one stage and impossible to spend much time in order to determine requirements completely using traditional ways in agile methods, screening and some other ways are required to identify needs in the agile method. This paper is aimed to study requirements and identify strategies of useful and useless ones to develop the software via agile methods because of the need to the software and different competitions between developers in rapid software providing perfect and with a high quality."

We describe our means of managing the interactions -- by extending the standard XP requirements process while maintaining consistency with the principles of XP itself. We outline our rationale for modifying the XP requirements process, and provide a temporal comparison showing that, for this project, modified process is essential to successful application of RIM."
2066.0,Excluded,ec7,Requirements Negotiation for Multilayer System Components," Current software systems are hybrid in nature. They are built by integrating third party Off-The-Shelf (OTS) components with preexisting legacy and bespoke custom-made software. In such systems, components are usually arranged into layers (e.g., hardware platform, operating systems and database layers, among others) to allow for their operation and interaction. Although several methods have been proposed to support OTS component selection, the truth is that in many cases the process is driven by political and other non-technical aspects, considering components as independent and isolated. Because of this, relevant stakeholder's requirements and concerns, as well as the implications that the selection of a particular component may bring to the system architecture, are simply ignored. In the worst case this may lead to the selection of unsuited or inappropriate components and eventually to miscarried projects, but more often to situations in which projects froze due to lack of stakeholders' agreement in relation to the newly created architectural scenario and some of its emerging requirements. In this paper we address these issues and present a proposal that uses software quality models as framework to support the negotiation of both initial and emerging requirements and the reconciliation of stakeholders' concerns. The approach considers components at different layers of system's architecture. The advantages of the proposal are illustrated with a real case conducted in a banking organization."
2067.0,Excluded,ec7,Requirements Negotiation Model: A Social Oriented Approach for Software Ecosystems Evolution," Software Ecosystems is becoming a relevant research topic by analysing the software industry as networked organisations based on a common interest in a central software technology. In this context, appropriately handling Requirements Engineering is a success factor for Software Platform Management. Nevertheless, recent research in this subject does not integrate the ecosystem's social dimension to a business view during requirements negotiations. The state-of-the-art is generally concerned with challenges of achieving and agreed requirements understanding. Thereby, this PhD proposes a Requirements Negotiation Model to address the negotiation process through a more holistic perspective. It aims to present an insightful reasoning on how requirements negotiation collaborates to ecosystem's health and success, defining negotiation strategies along Software Ecosystem evolution considering the Software Platform Management."
2068.0,Excluded,ec7,Requirements Processes Process Improvement for Traceability: A Study of Human Fallibility," Human analysts working with results from automated traceability tools often make incorrect decisions that lead to lower quality final trace matrices. As the human must vet the results of trace tools for mission- and safety-critical systems, the hopes of developing expedient and accurate tracing procedures lies in understanding how analysts work with trace matrices. This paper describes a study to understand when and why humans make correct and incorrect decisions during tracing tasks through logs of analyst actions. In addition to the traditional measures of recall and precision to describe the accuracy of the results, we introduce and study new measures that focus on analyst work quality: potential recall, sensitivity, and effort distribution. We use these measures to visualize analyst progress towards the final trace matrix, identifying factors that may influence their performance and determining how actual tracing strategies, derived from analyst logs, affect results."
2069.0,Excluded,ec7,Requirements Reuse at Danfoss," Requirements engineering is an essential activity in creating embedded real-time systems. Companies that produce a number of partially similar products can reduce development time and cost, improve quality and simplify software maintenance by applying reuse practices. Requirements reuse is an essential enabler to achieve effective software reuse. This study describes two different approaches for requirements reuse at Danfoss. The first approach reuses those requirements that are envisioned to be common between two consecutive projects and allows changing and parameterization of parts of the requirements. The second approach organizes all requirements into a common model and explicitly manages variability and different requirement variants in this common model. The results show that both approaches can result in significant savings in reduced effort by reusing common requirements. The first approach was found to be effective when the domain maturity is low and the significant set of requirements were changed from project to project. The second approach allows high reuse potential and significant savings for stable domains, where most requirements tend to be small additions or minor changes of existing requirements."
2070.0,Included,included,Requirements Reviews Revisited: Residual Challenges and Open Research Questions," It is widely accepted that early reviews on requirements specifications (RS) are an effective and efficient quality assurance technique. So why are they still not applied all over the software industry? In this paper we pinpoint that this is due to five major challenges: 1) Software requirements are based on flawed `upstream' requirements and reviews on RS are thus in vain. 2) The impact of sociological issues related to reviews is underestimated. 3) Important quality aspects of RS escape reviews. 4) The goal of applying reviews is not made clear and different review approaches are mixed. 5) Incremental software development poses specific challenges to applying reviews on RS. In this paper we argue that in order to solve these five challenges research on reviews must take a more holistic approach, stretching to pre-project phases and incorporating various other disciplines in order to add more value for the software industry. The paper also offers preliminary solutions to the discussed challenges and sketches open research questions of high relevance for the software industry."
2071.0,Included,included,Requirements sensemaking using concept maps,"Requirements play an important role in software engineering, but their perceived usefulness means that they often fail to be properly maintained. Traceability is often considered a means for motivating and maintaining requirements, but this is difficult without a better understanding of the requirements themselves. Sensemaking techniques help us get this understanding, but the representations necessary to support it are difficult to create, and scale poorly when dealing with medium to large scale problems. This paper describes how, with the aid of supporting software tools, concept mapping can be used to both make sense of and improve the quality of a requirements specification. We illustrate this approach by using it to update the requirements specification for the EU webinos project, and discuss several findings arising from our results."
2072.0,Excluded,ec7,Requirements-Driven Adaptive Security: Protecting Variable Assets at Runtime," Security is primarily concerned with protecting assets from harm. Identifying and evaluating assets are therefore key activities in any security engineering process - from modeling threats and attacks, discovering existing vulnerabilities, to selecting appropriate countermeasures. However, despite their crucial role, assets are often neglected during the development of secure software systems. Indeed, many systems are designed with fixed security boundaries and assumptions, without the possibility to adapt when assets change unexpectedly, new threats arise, or undiscovered vulnerabilities are revealed. To handle such changes, systems must be capable of dynamically enabling different security countermeasures. This paper promotes assets as first-class entities in engineering secure software systems. An asset model is related to requirements, expressed through a goal model, and the objectives of an attacker, expressed through a threat model. These models are then used as input to build a causal network to analyze system security in different situations, and to enable, when necessary, a set of countermeasures to mitigate security threats. The causal network is conceived as a runtime entity that tracks relevant changes that may arise at runtime, and enables a new set of countermeasures. We illustrate and evaluate our proposed approach by applying it to a substantive example concerned with security of mobile phones."

However, the development of real industrial applications using the OPC standards at universities is limited due to the complexity and difficulty. In this paper, not only the current state of the OPC standards is provided, but also the current problems and how they can be managed and overcome are discussed. The general integration architecture based on the new OPC Unified Architecture (UA) specifications is then proposed and presented together with the initial results from the performed simulation. The potential areas of the proposed architecture and the redundancy strategies to increase the efficiency and reliability of the system are also introduced."

Both software development and research are knowledge-intensive endeavors. While agile approaches have been increasingly adopted in software development projects, whether such approaches can beneficially be applied to conducting research is a phenomenon yet to be fully explored. The objective of the workshop was to gain a deeper understanding of the similarities and differences between academic research and agile software development, in order to explore whether agile practices can also be used for collaboratively conducted research. The opinions of the workshop participants are summarized and observations of the research dojo session carried out by the participants are reported. We conclude by identifying further areas for investigation."

An open architecture control system capable of distributed processing of decision-making and extraction of task information provides a premise for intelligent control and flexible operation. Intelligent detection with database feedback based on real-time assignment of tasks is proposed to achieve dynamic modification of the processing trajectory. In the context of flexible task control, a multi-robot architecture with collision-free path planning and a novel programming approach based on parameter-driven technology are developed. The proposed \{CNC\} system has been successfully implemented and demonstrated on an H-beam steel-cutting task that requires flexible and accurate machining."
2078.0,Excluded,ec3,Research synthesis in software engineering: A tertiary study,"Context Comparing and contrasting evidence from multiple studies is necessary to build knowledge and reach conclusions about the empirical support for a phenomenon. Therefore, research synthesis is at the center of the scientific enterprise in the software engineering discipline. Objective The objective of this article is to contribute to a better understanding of the challenges in synthesizing software engineering research and their implications for the progress of research and practice. Method A tertiary study of journal articles and full proceedings papers from the inception of evidence-based software engineering was performed to assess the types and methods of research synthesis in systematic reviews in software engineering. Results As many as half of the 49 reviews included in the study did not contain any synthesis. Of the studies that did contain synthesis, two thirds performed a narrative or a thematic synthesis. Only a few studies adequately demonstrated a robust, academic approach to research synthesis. Conclusion We concluded that, despite the focus on systematic reviews, there is limited attention paid to research synthesis in software engineering. This trend needs to change and a repertoire of synthesis methods needs to be an integral part of systematic reviews to increase their significance and utility for research and practice."
2079.0,Excluded,ec7,Resolving Uncertainty in Automotive Feature Interactions," The modern automobile is a complex electronic system with a number of features providing functionalities for driver and passenger convenience, control of the vehicle, and safety of the occupants. As new features are developed and introduced into the automobile, they interact with already existing features, sometimes resulting in undesirable behaviours. These undesirable interactions are often detected very late in the development cycle, or sometimes even in the field. This introduces uncertainty in the system development process as changes to address these interactions often result in a cascading series of changes whose scope is difficult to predict. This paper presents a method and algorithms for identifying and resolving feature interactions early in the development life-cycle by addressing the problem at the level of requirements specifications. We have applied this method successfully in the automotive domain and present a case study of detecting and resolving feature interactions."

Particularly, in an environment with a huge number of workflow consumers requesting a decentralized cross-organizational workflow, performance evaluation and execution-management of service-oriented workflows gain in importance. The need for an effective and efficient workflow management forces enterprises to use intelligent optimization models and heuristics to compose workflows out of several services under real-time conditions. This paper introduces the required architecture Workflow Performance Extension - WPX.KOM for resource planning and workload prediction purposes. Furthermore, optimization approaches and a high-performance heuristic solving the addressed resource planning problem with low computational overhead are presented."
2081.0,Excluded,ec3,"Restoring ""coding with intention"" in introductory programming courses","This descriptive study discusses two conceptual difficulties encountered by students in introductory programming courses regardless of the chosen language or pedagogical approach (e.g. objects, classes or fundamentals first). Firstly, students tend to learn programming by memorizing correct code examples instead of acquiring the programming thought process. Secondly, they tend to read code by ""flying"" over it at a comfortable altitude while thinking to its assumed intent. While relaxing, this practice fails to train students to develop the rigor to catch bugs in others' or their own code. Both trends result in an almost complete loss of intentionality in the programming activity; un-innovative code is generated by analogy with (or cut and paste from) existing solutions and is then almost randomly modified until ""it fits"" the minimal tests requirements without real analysis of its flaws. We review and evaluate pedagogical strategies which can be leveraged by instructors to address the above mentioned issues. Namely, we discuss the benefits of various forms of ""Live coding"" and test-driven pair programming active learning practices."
2082.0,Excluded,ec3,Results from introducing component-level test automation and Test-Driven Development,"For many software development organizations it is of crucial importance to reduce development costs while still maintaining high product quality. Since testing commonly constitutes a significant part of the development time, one way to increase efficiency is to find more faults early when they are cheaper to pinpoint and remove. This paper presents empirical results from introducing a concept for early fault detection. That is, an alternative approach to Test-Driven Development which was applied on a component level instead of on a class/method level. The selected method for evaluating the result of introducing the concept was based on an existing method for fault-based process assessment and was proven practically useful for evaluating fault reducing improvements. The evaluation was made on two industrial projects and on different features within a project that only implemented the concept partly. The evaluation result demonstrated improvements regarding decreased fault rates and Return On Investment (ROI), e.g. the total project cost became about 5â€“6% less already in the first two studied projects."
2083.0,Excluded,ec3,Rethinking dichotomization: A critical perspective on the use of â€œhardâ€� and â€œsoftâ€� in project management research,"Abstract This paper elaborates on the categorization â€“ dichotomization â€“ between â€œhardâ€� and â€œsoftâ€� in project management research. This categorization is becoming more increasingly used in project management research for example by stating that some projects are â€œhardâ€�, while other projects are â€œsoftâ€�, that some project skills are â€œhardâ€�, while other project skills are â€œsoftâ€� etc. The aim is to discuss this dichotomization as an example of hierarchization â€“ a power struggle between opposites â€“ within project management research and literature and acknowledge the effects for project management research and practice of unreflective upholding of this dichotomy. We provide a critical review and discussion of stage-gate models as an example of â€œhardâ€� project management approaches, and agile methods as an example of â€œsoftâ€� approaches to project management and acknowledge that in project management practice, it seems as if â€œhardâ€� and â€œsoftâ€� approaches are most often combined. Hence, this dichotomy seems to be upheld by the research community while practitioners show a more holistic perspective to project management."
2084.0,Excluded,ec3,Reuse: reducing test effort,"Testing effort consumes more than half of all development effort and is one of the important factors, which obstruct quality assurance. Software reuse enhances quality and productivity and at the same time reduces the time-to-market of the software products. As reuse applies to the development process, so too, it applies to the testing process. In this paper, we discuss reuse-oriented test approaches, which are used to reduce the testing effort. Further, we present the state-of-the-art in reuse-oriented test approaches employed in reuseoriented development processes. At the end of the current paper, we argue that the current trend is towards built-in test and model based testing in the applications developed through reusable software."

We ground this assertion in an exemplar field study that examined the use of documentation in software maintenance environments. Specific examples are unpacked to reveal a depth of insight that would not have been possible using standard interviews. This afforded a better understanding of the complex relationship between project personnel and documentation, including individualsâ€™ roles as pointers, gatekeepers, or barriers to documentation."

2102.0,Excluded,ec7,Risk and Argument: A Risk-Based Argumentation Method for Practical Security," When showing that a software system meets certain security requirements, it is often necessary to work with formal and informal descriptions of the system behavior, vulnerabilities, and threats from potential attackers. In earlier work, Haley et al. [1] showed structured argumentation could deal with such mixed descriptions. However, incomplete and uncertain information, and limited resources force practitioners to settle for good-enough security. To deal with these conditions of practice, we extend the method of Haley et al. with risk assessment. The proposed method, RISA (RIsk assessment in Security Argumentation), uses public catalogs of security expertise to support the risk assessment, and to guide the security argumentation in identifying rebuttals and mitigations for security requirements satisfaction. We illustrate RISA with a realistic example of PIN Entry Device."
2103.0,Excluded,ec3,Risks and risk mitigation in global software development: A tertiary study,"Abstract Context There is extensive interest in global software development (GSD) which has led to a large number of papers reporting on GSD. A number of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) have attempted to aggregate information from individual studies. Objective We wish to investigate \{GSD\} \{SLR\} research with a focus on discovering what research has been conducted in the area and to determine if the \{SLRs\} furnish appropriate risk and risk mitigation advice to provide guidance to organizations involved with GSD. Method We performed a broad automated search to identify \{GSD\} SLRs. Data extracted from each study included: (1) authors, their affiliation and publishing venue, (2) \{SLR\} quality, (3) research focus, (4) \{GSD\} risks, (5) risk mitigation strategies and, (6) for each \{SLR\} the number of primary studies reporting each risk and risk mitigation strategy. Results We found a total of 37 papers reporting 24 unique \{GSD\} \{SLR\} studies. Major \{GSD\} topics covered include: (1) organizational environment, (2) project execution, (3) project planning and control and (4) project scope and requirements. We extracted 85 risks and 77 risk mitigation advice items and categorized them under four major headings: outsourcing rationale, software development, human resources, and project management. The largest group of risks was related to project management. \{GSD\} outsourcing rationale risks ranked highest in terms of primary study support but in many cases these risks were only identified by a single SLR. Conclusions The focus of the \{GSD\} \{SLRs\} we identified is mapping the research rather than providing evidence-based guidance to industry. Empirical support for the majority of risks identified is moderate to low, both in terms of the number of \{SLRs\} identifying the risk, and in the number of primary studies providing empirical support. Risk mitigation advice is also limited, and empirical support for these items is low."

As software development platforms mature they provide increasingly sophisticated capabilities for process measurement and guidance. These new capabilities in turn offer an excellent opportunity for governance tools to help guide the development. In this paper we discuss a model of the development organization that includes: roles, responsibilities, decisions, rights, artifacts and their lifecycles. We show how this model can be elicited and deployed as part of a governance solution to guide the development organization and provide a description of a prototype we have built to automate this process.

2107.0,Excluded,ec3,ROPAS: Cross-Layer Cognitive Architecture for Mobile UWB Networks,"The allocation of bandwidth to unlicensed users, without significantly increasing the interference on the existing licensed users, is a challenge for Ultra Wideband (UWB) networks. Our research work presents a novel Rake Optimization and Power Aware Scheduling (ROPAS) architecture for UWB networks. Since UWB communication is rich in multipath effects, a Rake receiver is used for path diversity. Our idea of developing an optimized Rake receiver in our ROPAS architecture stems from the intention of reducing the computation complexity in terms of the number of multiplications and additions needed for the weight derivation attached to each finger of the Rake receiver. Our proposed work uses the Cognitive Radio (CR) for dynamic channel allocation among the requesting users while limiting the average power transmitted in each sub-band. In our proposed novel ROPAS architecture, dynamic channel allocation is achieved by a CR-based cross-layer design between the PHY and Medium Access Control (MAC) layers. Additionally, the maximum number of parallel transmissions within a frame interval is formulated as an optimization problem. This optimal decision is based on the distance parameter between a transmitter-receiver pair, bit error rate and frequency of request by a particular application. Moreover, the optimization problem improvises a differentiation technique among the requesting applications by incorporating priority levels among user applications. This provides fairness and higher throughput among services with varying power constraint and data rates required for a UWB network."

2112.0,Excluded,ec3,Safety certification of airborne software: An empirical study,"Many safety-critical aircraft functions are software-enabled. Airborne software must be audited and approved by the aerospace certification authorities prior to deployment. The auditing process is time-consuming, and its outcome is unpredictable, due to the criticality and complex nature of airborne software. To ensure that the engineering of airborne software is systematically regulated and is auditable, certification authorities mandate compliance with safety standards that detail industrial best practice. This paper reviews existing practices in software safety certification. It also explores how software safety audits are performed in the civil aerospace domain. The paper then proposes a statistical method for supporting software safety audits by collecting and analysing data about the software throughout its lifecycle. This method is then empirically evaluated through an industrial case study based on data collected from 9 aerospace projects covering 58 software releases. The results of this case study show that our proposed method can help the certification authorities and the software and safety engineers to gain confidence in the certification readiness of airborne software and predict the likely outcome of the audits. The results also highlight some confidentiality issues concerning the management and retention of sensitive data generated from safety-critical projects."

This paper aims to explore the complicated finger gaits planning problem and provide a method for robotic hands to autonomously generate feasible finger gaits to accomplish given tasks. Based on the hybrid automaton formulation of a popular finger gaiting primitive, finger substitution, we formulate the finger gait planning problem into a classic motion planning problem with a hybrid configuration space. Inspired by the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) techniques, we develop a finger gait planner to quickly search for a feasible manipulation strategy with finger substitution primitives. To increase the search performance of the planner, we further develop a refined sampling strategy, a novel hybrid distance and an efficient exploring strategy with the consideration of the problem’s hybrid nature. Finally, we use a representative numerical example to verify the validity of our problem formulation and the performance of the RRT based finger gait planner."

Agile methods were seen initially as best suited to small, co-located teams developing non-critical systems. The first two constraining characteristics (small and co-located teams) have been addressed as research has emerged describing successful agile adoption involving large teams and distributed contexts. However, the applicability of agile methods for developing safety-critical systems in regulated environments has not yet been demonstrated unequivocally, and very little rigorous research exists in this area. Some of the essential characteristics of agile approaches appear to be incompatible with the constraints imposed by regulated environments. In this study we identify these tension points and illustrate through a detailed case study how an agile approach was implemented successfully in a regulated environment. Among the interesting concepts to emerge from the research are the notions of continuous compliance and living traceability."

2123.0,Included,included,"Scenarios, personas and user stories: User-centered evidence-based design representations of communicable disease investigations","AbstractPurpose Despite years of effort and millions of dollars spent to create unified electronic communicable disease reporting systems, the goal remains elusive. A major barrier has been a lack of understanding by system designers of communicable disease (CD) work and the public health workers who perform this work. This study reports on the application of user-centered design representations, traditionally used for improving interface design, to translate the complex \{CD\} work identified through ethnographic studies to guide designers and developers of \{CD\} systems. The purpose of this work is to: (1) better understand public health practitioners and their information workflow with respect to \{CD\} monitoring and control at a local health agency, and (2) to develop evidence-based design representations that model this \{CD\} work to inform the design of future disease surveillance systems. Methods We performed extensive onsite semi-structured interviews, targeted work shadowing and a focus group to characterize local health agency \{CD\} workflow. Informed by principles of design ethnography and user-centered design we created persona, scenarios and user stories to accurately represent the user to system designers. Results We sought to convey to designers the key findings from ethnographic studies: (1) public health \{CD\} work is mobile and episodic, in contrast to current \{CD\} reporting systems, which are stationary and fixed, (2) health agency efforts are focused on \{CD\} investigation and response rather than reporting and (3) current \{CD\} information systems must conform to public health workflow to ensure their usefulness. In an effort to illustrate our findings to designers, we developed three contemporary design-support representations: persona, scenario, and user story. Conclusions Through application of user-centered design principles, we were able to create design representations that illustrate complex public health communicable disease workflow and key user characteristics to inform the design of \{CD\} information systems for public health."
2124.0,Excluded,ec3,Scheduling of conflicting refactorings to promote quality improvement,"Software refactoring is to restructure object-oriented software to improve its quality, especially extensibility, reusability and maintainability while preserving its external behaviors. For a special software system, there are usually quite a few refactorings available at the same time. But these refactorings may conflict with each other. In other words, carrying out a refactoring may disable other refactorings. Consequently, only a subset of the available refactorings can be applied together, and which refactorings will be applied depends on the schedule (application order) of the refactorings. Furthermore, carrying out different subsets of the refactorings usually leads to different improvement of software quality. As a result, in order to promote the improvement of software quality, refactorings should be scheduled rationally. However, how to schedule refactorings is rarely discussed. Usually, software engineers carry out refactorings immediately when they are found out. They do not wait until all applicable refactorings are found out and scheduled. In other words, the refactorings are not scheduled explicitly, and conflicts among them are not taken into consideration. Though more and more refactorings are formalized and automated by refactoring tools, refactoring tools apply refactorings usually in a nondeterministic fashion (in random). In this paper, we propose a scheduling approach to schedule conflicting refactorings to promote the improvement of software quality achieved by refactorings. Conflicts among refactorings are detected, and then a scheduling model is presented. And then a heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the scheduling model. Results of experiments suggest that the proposed scheduling approach is effective in promoting the improvement of software quality"
2125.0,Excluded,ec3,Scheduling projects with heterogeneous resources to meet time and quality objectives,"In service organizations, heterogeneity in workforce skills can lead to variation in end-product/service quality. The multi-mode, resource-constrained, project scheduling problem (MRCPSP), which assumes similar skills among resources in a given resource pool, accounts for differences in quality levels of individuals by assigning different activity durations depending on the skill level used. This approach is often inadequate to model the problem type investigated here. Using typical projects from the customer training division of a large telecommunications company (which motivated this research), a labor assignment problem using a successive workâ€“time concept is formulated and solved using integer programming optimization procedures. The setting represents a multiple-project environment where projects are separate and independent, but require the same renewable resource mix for their completion. The paper demonstrates how the output of the model can be used to identify bottlenecks (or critical resource skills), and also demonstrates how cross-training the appropriately skilled groups or individuals can increase throughput. The approach guides decision-making concerning which workers to cross-train in order to extract the greatest benefits from worker-flexibility."

We examined system administrator practices in software tool development, operations, and maintenance based on ethnographic field studies at service delivery centers and data centers across the United States. Our findings suggest that software practices were mostly informal and collaborative and mixed within formal change processes; tool development and debugging were interleaved with tool use and maintenance as they interacted with live systems; and the complexity of large-scale systems and the risks involved in changing live and critical systems put increased demands on system administrators. We argue that system administrators might benefit from certain software engineering methodologies such as agile software development and software modeling."

Phase 1 was a four month endeavor with a primary focus of collecting data to understand why support was so costly and identify the root cause for each support request. The team strongly believed that this initial phase would be critical to making significant impacts to the quality and supportability of applications. This experience report describes the challenge for the Support 2.0 team and shares the successful adoption of agile practices in redefining the support organization. In the spirit of the agile transition to software development one year prior, our IT organization decided to rethink the approach to application support. By embracing agile principles and utilizing agile concepts, such as a cross functional team, a team collaboration approach with frequent reviews to inspect and adapt as needed, etc, the business was able to reap immediate benefits. It was a challenging journey for the team, where the mix of onshore-offshore support engineers and an integrated client-vendor relationship within an agile team and focused framework helped to transform the support organization from an operational cost center to a value added thought partner. This resulted in a significantly improved culture and effectiveness of the support organization. This unique organization of an agile, cross-functional and team-based approach to handle support requests improved the customer experience, reduced support costs, and ultimately provided greater opportunity for the business to fund new development efforts."
2130.0,Excluded,ec6,Scrum across the CS/SE curricula: a retrospective,"Scrum is one of the many agile approaches to software development that have been widely adopted over the past decade. Agile processes allow developers to embrace under-defined problems in complex environments where change in requirements is inevitable. The key agile features of Scrum are a flexible, adaptive schedule; democratic, collaborative teams; and frequent, iterative project and process reviews [2]. While students may engage with Scrum in the context of software development, the characteristics that suit many software problems to an agile approach also describe the student learning environment: complexity (new and unfamiliar concepts), under-defined problem space (students don't know what they don't know), short timeframe with frequent meetings (terms and class meetings), and inevitable change (apply new knowledge). This makes Scrum not only a software development strategy but a general learning strategy. Scrum facilitates frequent and iterative practice with timely feedback, development of mastery, and self-direction [1]. In this panel, the participants will describe how their students learn and practice Scrum in a software development context, how they use it to manage student projects outside the software development context, and how Scrum provides opportunities to integrate communication skills into the Computer Science (CS) and Software Engineering (SE) curricula.

Systematic institutionalized Scrum across all projects and used data driven tools like story process efficiency to surface product backlog impediments. This allowed them to systematically develop a strategy for a second doubling in productivity. Two teams have achieved a sustainable quadrupling of productivity compared to waterfall projects. We discuss here the strategy to bring the entire company to that level. Our experiences shows that Scrum and CMMI together bring a more powerful combination of adaptability and predictability than either one alone and suggest how other companies can combine them to achieve Toyota level performance - 4 times the productivity and 12 times the quality of waterfall teams."

Then, after deciding to learn more about a certain offering, Scrum training, the teams found a way to take more control over this process. In the fall of 2010, the iSense sales and account management teams decided to adopt Scrum internally as their best practice. Scrum transformed the random process, revealing early indicators related to final sales results, and showed that the direct causes for closing a deal could be detected and controlled. Once it became possible to predict and influence final order intake and sales numbers, the sales teams used early predictive indicators to proactively control their work. With the sales processes under better control, the teams could improve continuously and have more fun at work.

Agile methods can achieve a high level of satisfaction among all project stakeholders (users, customers, business managers, developers, and project managers) in terms of productivity, product quality, cost containment, time-to-market, and overall morale. Success with agile requires focus on requirements and design as a continuous discovery process, posing challenges for practitioners of more traditional project management both in terms of method adoption and sustained commitment. Thriving Systems Theory clarifies the appeal of agile project structure and processes, helps project teams determine and achieve the optimal portfolio of quality characteristics, and better articulate their value to all stakeholders. Thriving Systems Theory is an emerging framework of systems design quality that translates the research of design pattern patriarch Christopher Alexander on physical architecture design quality into the domain of systems engineering. The satisfaction achieved through agile methods is explained by Thriving Systems Theory's fifteen choice properties of systems design quality.

Scrum has been increasingly adopted in large software development organizations. This has led to changes to Scrum practices, but it is not known if these changes are harmful. Objective: We studied how the requirements were planned and managed in the development teams of a large Scrum organization, how well the requirements planning and management practices matched Scrum, and whether the changes were perceived harmful. Method: We quantitatively analysed 435 requirements spanning a time period of approximately one year. We conducted a total of 40 interviews to study the Scrum adoption in the organization and to explain and validate the quantitative results. Results: The main discrepancies between the organization's practices and Scrum were the pacing of the planning process, which was more akin to a continuous process instead of the iteration-paced Scrum model, and the average time it took to develop requirements, which was considerably longer than the time prescribed by Scrum. The latter discrepancy was considered slightly harmful. Conclusion: Changes to the Scrum practices should be evaluated in their context to separate harmful ones from necessary or beneficial changes mandated by the organizational context."

In order to teach students to be able to apply \{SCRUM\} in concrete situations, often educational (simulation) games are used. However, most of these games have been developed more for professional trainings than taking into consideration typical restrictions of university courses (such as, class duration and low financial resources for instructional materials). Therefore, we present a manual paper and pencil game to reinforce and teach the application of \{SCRUM\} in undergraduate computing programmes complementing theoretical lectures. The game has been developed following a systematic instructional design process and based on our teaching experience. It has been applied several times in two undergraduate project management courses. We evaluated motivation, user experience and the game's contribution to learning through case studies on Kirkpatrick's level one based on the perception of the students. First results indicate the potential of the game to contribute to the learning of \{SCRUM\} in an engaging way, keeping students immersed in the learning task.

Although they are distinct from each other per se, our research found that PSP and SCRUM may also complement each other when SCRUM provides an agile process management framework, and PSP provides the skills and disciplines that a qualified team member needs to estimate, plan and manage his/her job. This paper proposes an integrated process model, SCRUM-PSP, which combines the strengths of each. We also verified that this integrated process by adopting it into a real project environment where typical agile processes are favored, i.e. change-prone requirements, rapid development, fast delivery, etc. As a result, manageability and predictability which traditional plan-driven processes usually benefit can also be achieved.

A synthetic scenario, based on an on-line system, shows how the SOMM is used to anticipate malicious behaviour with respect to an operational information system and to document a priori how this malicious behaviour should be mitigated.

First, we model security threats as misuse stories, similar to user stories except that we focus on illegal or non-normative use of the application. Subsequently, we create security tests in Selenium that manifest the misuse stories by exploiting vulner-abilities in the application. This approach can be seen as a contribution to strengthening the security focus in agile projects by trying to apply familiar agile concepts, methods, and tools to the security aspects of the application. We have found that several of the most common security vulnerabilities in web applications can be addressed with this approach, such as cross site scripting (XSS), broken authentication and access management, information leakage, and improper error handling.

To this end, we used the lens of the Personal Responsibility Orientation [2] to measure the impact on student self-efficacy and self direction of our interventions. These learning activities were introduced based on peer learning and authentic student feedback principles. They consisted of peer learning weekly forums and student-led """"live coding"""" hands-on exercises.

This often leads to faster enhancements, at a lower cost, and with fewer defects. However, when these practices are not followed, problems within the code base can manifest themselves as technical debt. The following report details the experience of one team in trying to influence toward greater understanding in and investment toward their technical debt problem by making that problem visible. The team hangs large representations of their code base in the walkway by their desks. The charts create conversation in and around the team and eventually shows results."
2157.0,Excluded,ec7,Semantic Criteria for Choosing a Language for Big-Step Models," With the popularity of model-driven methodologies, and the abundance of modelling languages, a major question for a requirements engineer is: which language is suitable for modelling a system under study? We address this question from a semantic point-of-view for big-step modelling languages (BSMLs). BSMLs are a class of popular behavioural modelling languages in which a model can respond to an input by executing multiple, possibly concurrent, transitions. We deconstruct the operational semantics of a large class of BSMLs into high-level, orthogonal semantic aspects, and analyze the relative advantages and disadvantages of the common semantic options for each of these aspects. Our goal is to empower a requirements engineer to compare and choose an appropriate BSML."
2158.0,Excluded,ec7,Semantic-Based Interaction Detection in Aspect-Oriented Scenarios," Interactions between dependent or conflicting aspects are a well-known problem with aspect-oriented development (and related paradigms). These interactions are potentially dangerous and can lead to unexpected or incorrect results when aspects are composed. To date, most aspect interaction detection methods have been based either on purely syntactic comparisons or have relied on heavyweight formal methods. We present a new approach that is based instead on lightweight semantic annotations of aspects. Each aspect is annotated with domain-specific markers and a separate influence model describes how semantic markers from different domains influence each other. Automated analysis can then be used both to highlight semantic aspect conflicts and to trade-off aspects. We apply this technique to early aspects, namely, aspect scenarios, because it is desirable to detect aspect interactions as early in the software lifecycle as possible. We evaluate the technique using an industrial case study and show that the technique detects interactions that cannot be discovered using syntactic techniques."

The key words here are specifications and generate. We let users specify what they are looking for as precisely as possible using keywords, class or method signatures, test cases, contracts, and security constraints. Our system then uses an open set of program transformations to map retrieved code into what the user asked for. This approach is implemented in a prototype system for Java with a web interface."
2160.0,Excluded,ec7,Semi-Automatic Identification of Features in Requirement Specifications, Reuse of requirements leads to reduction in time spent for specification of new products. Variant management of requirement documents is an essential prerequisite in terms of a successful reuse of requirements. It supports the decisions if available requirements can be reused or not. One possibility to document the variability is feature modelling. One main challenge while introducing feature modelling in a grown environment is to extract product features from large natural language specifications. The current practice is a manual review of specifications conducted by domain experts. This procedure is very costly in terms of time. A promising approach to optimize feature identification is a semi-automatic identification of features in natural language specifications based on lexical analysis. This paper presents the current approaches used for handling variability in automotive specifications at Daimler passenger car development along with first experiences gained in using the optimized approach for feature identification using a lexical analysis.

Web 2.0 features are changing the way citizens interact and participate. Here we leverage this with a sense-respond architecture between two clouds: a) a front-end social networks of communities and citizens, and b) back-end enterprise application services. We introduce an Adaptive Complex Environment (ACE) ontology and mediator architecture for complex service-intensive organizations. This mediator architecture is illustrated using Web 2.0 (e.g. Facebook services) to make tacit service requirements of user communities explicit, leading to the adaptation in the use of back-end services. We also present a specific eGovernment application scenario where the services are identified, designed, delivered and evolved by employing ACE. We thus motivate research in management environments in which stakeholder participation, development, and operational aspects are integrated so that services can be co-engineered (i.e. collaboratively, continuously and concurrently)."

Based on well-established game industry practices we followed an iterative agile process with Scrum and managed to avoid many classical pitfalls in game development. While we achieved some measure of success, in post-project analysis, it becomes obvious that our process would have benefited from the heavy emphasis of 'users' in the User-Centered Design (UCD) methods.

It brings new challenges in different aspects, such as: reuse, flexibility, stakeholders' involvement, business understanding. Considering methods for system development, those aspects are handled by agile methods. However, there is no consensus on how to use agile methods in service-oriented system development. Agile methods can be used in different phases of a software development lifecycle, such as: project management, modeling, software construction, software testing. Extreme Programming (XP) is one of the methods more closely related to the construction phase. XP is widely adopted in the industry and offers practices that can be applied to several business contexts. The goal of this work is to propose guidelines and best practices towards service development, focused on the construction phase, in an SOA environment using XP. It goes towards the identification of the shared concerns and the gaps between SOA and XP practices and, additionally, presents open issues and main challenges to be considered when incrementally constructing service solutions with continuous feedback and flexibility to rapidly develop services that meet changing business requirements."

Much work is still needed to support such commu- nities with mechanisms able to proactively react to community dynamism. We argue that service-networks can be used to deliver this support.

2168.0,Excluded,ec3,Shock Therapy: A Bootstrap for Hyper-Productive Scrum,"A properly implemented Scrum framework enforces a few simple constraints that cause a team to self-organize into a state that achieves 5 to 10 times waterfall performance. Yet the majority of Scrum teams never achieve this design goal. Teams do not know how to sequence work to deliver working software at the end of a sprint. They do not know how to work with a Product Owner to get the backlog in a ready state before bringing it into a sprint and do not know how to self-organize into a hyper-productive state during a sprint. A pattern is emerging at MySpace in California and Jayway in Sweden, for bootstrapping high performing Scrum teams. Rigorous implementation of Scrum by an experienced coach creates a total immersion experience akin to Shock Therapy. Teams are trained on exactly how to implement Scrum with no deviations for several sprints. These teams consistently achieve better than 240% improvement in velocity within a few weeks. They are then able to self-organize on their own to continue to improve performance. For many developers and managers, the experience is a wake up call to agile awareness. Unfortunately, management tends to disrupt hyper-productive teams by disabling key constraints in the Scrum framework. Team velocity then falls back into mediocrity. Velocity data is provided on five hyper-productive teams at MySpace and one team at Jayway. In all but one case, management ldquokilled the golden goose""."
2169.0,Excluded,ec3,Should software testers use mutation analysis to augment a test set?,"Mutation testing has historically been used to assess the fault-finding effectiveness of a test suite or other verification technique. Mutation analysis, rather, entails augmenting a test suite to detect all killable mutants. Concerns about the time efficiency of mutation analysis may prohibit its widespread, practical use. The goal of our research is to assess the effectiveness of the mutation analysis process when used by software testers to augment a test suite to obtain higher statement coverage scores. We conducted two empirical studies and have shown that mutation analysis can be used by software testers to effectively produce new test cases and to improve statement coverage scores in a feasible amount of time. Additionally, we find that our user study participants view mutation analysis as an effective but relatively expensive technique for writing new test cases. Finally, we have shown that the choice of mutation tool and operator set can play an important role in determining how efficient mutation analysis is for producing new test cases."
2170.0,Excluded,ec7,Simple software processes and tests improve the reliability and usefulness of a model,"Models are abstractions of reality that have predetermined limits (often not consciously thought through) on what problem domains the models can be used to explore. These limits are determined by the range of observed data used to construct and validate the model. However, it is important to remember that operating the model beyond these limits, one of the reasons for building the model in the first place, potentially brings unwanted behaviour and thus reduces the usefulness of the model. Our experience with the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM), a farming systems model, has led us to adapt techniques from the disciplines of modelling and software development to create a model development process. This process is simple, easy to follow, and brings a much higher level of stability to the development effort, which then delivers a much more useful model. A major part of the process relies on having a range of detailed model tests (unit, simulation, sensibility, validation) that exercise a model at various levels (sub-model, model and simulation). To underline the usefulness of testing, we examine several case studies where simulated output can be compared with simple relationships. For example, output is compared with crop water use efficiency relationships gleaned from the literature to check that the model reproduces the expected function. Similarly, another case study attempts to reproduce generalised hydrological relationships found in the literature. This paper then describes a simple model development process (using version control, automated testing and differencing tools), that will enhance the reliability and usefulness of a model."
2171.0,Excluded,ec7,Simplifying environmental model reuse,"The environmental modelling community has developed many models with varying levels of complexity and functionality. Many of these have overlapping problem domains, have very similar â€˜scienceâ€™ and yet are not compatible with each other. The modelling community recognises the benefits to model exchange and reuse, but often it is perceived to be easier to (re)create a new model than to take an existing one and adapt it to new needs. Many of these third party models have been incorporated into the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM), a farming systems modelling framework. Some of the issues encountered during this process were system boundary issues (the functional boundary between models and sub-models), mixed programming languages, differences in data semantics, intellectual property and ownership. This paper looks at these difficulties and how they were overcome. It explores some software development techniques that facilitated the process and discusses some guidelines that can not only make this process simpler but also move models towards framework independence."
2172.0,Excluded,ec7,Simulating and Optimising Design Decisions in Quantitative Goal Models, Making decisions among a set of alternative system designs is an essential activity of requirements engineering. It involves evaluating how well each alternative satisfies the stakeholders' goals and selecting one alternative that achieves some optimal tradeoffs between possibly conflicting goals. Quantitative goal models support such activities by describing how alternative system designs - expressed as alternative goal refinements and responsibility assignments - impact on the levels of goal satisfaction specified in terms of measurable objective functions. Analyzing large numbers of alternative designs in such models is an expensive activity for which no dedicated tool support is currently available. This paper takes a first step towards providing such support by presenting automated techniques for (i) simulating quantitative goal models so as to estimate the levels of goal satisfaction contributed by alternative system designs and (ii) optimising the system design by applying a multi-objective optimisation algorithm to search through the design space. These techniques are presented and validated using a quantitative goal model for a well-known ambulance service system.

The activities of the simulation model are described on the basis of a service-oriented approach in which content of the services is completely known. Micro, meso, and macro manufacturing levels are applied to the modeling and simulation. By means of these levels the hierarchy of the communication of the services is illustrated. An example is described in which modeling and simulation is used to proceed from ideas to efficiently operated manufacturing systems."

As the work advances, it's common to notice requirement changes on simulation projects due to the participants getting more and better understanding about the scope. The application of Agile methodologies, such as Scrum, can improve project management performance on simulation projects by the treatment of uncertainties. The performance improvement comes from the removal of no-value activities and treatment of: (1) activities plan; (2) clearer communication between customer and developers; (3) precise scope agreement; and (4) schedule definition.

The diabetic foot is one of the most fearful complications of diabetic patients and is responsible for fifty percent of non-traumatic lower-extremity amputations in general hospitals. Foot complications in diabetic patients can be prevented, in most of the cases, by submitting patients to continuous foot examinations and to a personal reeducation process. This paper describes an extension of SiSPED, a system to monitor patients with the possibility of developing the diabetic foot. In this extension the system has been entirely redesigned and new technologies are used to improve performance and maintainability. In addition, the rules applied to generate automatically a diagnostic report are updated to follow international guidelines applied in the diabetic foot prevention. The system also allows the correlation of patient data, essential to measure the impact of the methodology for diabetic foot prevention on the assisted population."

Our method can be used with or without other software development frameworks, and we argue that its application can save a relevant amount of implementation effort. Also, we believe that the method can be used in other fields of research, especially those that have a strong interdisciplinary nature. Background The idea emerged during a healthcare research project, which consisted among others in grouping information from heterogeneous and distributed information sources. We developed this methodology by the lessons learned when we had to build a data repository, containing information about elderly patients flows in the UK's long-term care system (LTC). Design We explain thoroughly those aspects that influenced the methodology building. The methodology is defined by six steps, which can be aligned with various iterative development frameworks. We describe here the alignment of our methodology with the \{RUP\} (rational unified process) framework. The methodology emphasizes current trends, as early identification of critical requirements, data modelling, close and timely interaction with users and stakeholders, ontology building, quality management, and exception handling. Results Of a special interest is the ontological engineering aspect, which had the effects with the highest impact after the project. That is, it helped stakeholders to perform better collaborative negotiations that brought better solutions for the overall system investigated. An insight into the problems faced by others helps to lead the negotiators to win-win situations. We consider that this should be the social result of any project that collects data for better decision making that leads finally to enhanced global outcomes."

Objective In this article, our goal was to extend and update the two previous tertiary studies to cover the period between 1st July 2008 and 31st December 2009. We analysed the quality, coverage of software engineering topics, and potential impact of published \{SLRs\} for education and practice. Method We performed automatic and manual searches for \{SLRs\} published in journals and conference proceedings, analysed the relevant studies, and compared and integrated our findings with the two previous tertiary studies. Results We found 67 new \{SLRs\} addressing 24 software engineering topics. Among these studies, 15 were considered relevant to the undergraduate educational curriculum, and 40 appeared of possible interest to practitioners. We found that the number of \{SLRs\} in software engineering is increasing, the overall quality of the studies is improving, and the number of researchers and research organisations worldwide that are conducting \{SLRs\} is also increasing and spreading. Conclusion Our findings suggest that the software engineering research community is starting to adopt \{SLRs\} consistently as a research method. However, the majority of the \{SLRs\} did not evaluate the quality of primary studies and fail to provide guidelines for practitioners, thus decreasing their potential impact on software engineering practice."

Due to the mandatory centralised control of license usage at application runtime, e.g. heartbeat control by the license server running at the home site of a user, traditional software licensing practices are not suitable especially when the distributed computing infrastructure stretches across administrative domains. In this paper we present a novel approach for managing software licenses as web service resources in distributed service oriented environments. Licenses become mobile objects, which may travel to the environment where required to authorise the execution of a license protected application. A first implementation has been realised for dynamic Grid environments in the European SmartLM project co-funded by the European Commission. The SmartLM solution decouples authorisation for license usage from authorisation for application execution. All authorisations are expressed as and guaranteed by Service Level Agreements. We will present the core technology, discuss various security aspects and how they are addressed in the SmartLM prototype, and present the evaluation of the prototype through a number of usage scenarios. Finally, we will give an outlook on specific issues and current work extending the solution to Clouds and service based systems in general."

It is primarily a question, of ensuring the decisional aspect of the information system of company by adopting the oriented architecture services like a support architecture. This engineering must ensure on the one hand the flexibility of the information system and on the other hand, avoids the redevelopment of system at the request of the decisions. In the actual position, several obstacles force the installation of the \{SOA\} within the company. It is basically a question of the lack of architecture to be implemented to define the services architecture within the information system of the company, which takes into account the decisional aspect. Moreover, there's no existing work which treats this challenge. In this paper, we describe an extended Service-Oriented Architecture - \{SOAda\} for supporting a decision aspect.

Objective This paper aims to bridge that gap by providing an empirically grounded software process model that can be used by software practitioners who want to build adaptable SBAs. The process model will focus only on the adaptation specific issues. Method The process model presented in this paper is based on data collected through interviews with 10 practitioners occupying various roles within eight different companies. The data was analyzed using qualitative data analysis techniques. We used the output to develop a set of activities, tasks, stakeholders and artifacts that were used to construct the process model. Results The outcome of the data analysis process was a process model identifying nine sets of adaptation process attributes. These can be used in conjunction with an organisationâ€™s existing development life-cycle or another reference life-cycle. Conclusion The process model developed in this paper provides a solid reference for practitioners who are planning to develop adaptable SBAs.

Based on this analysis we propose a new pragmatic framework for socio-technical systems engineering (STSE) which builds on the (largely independent) research of groups investigating work design, information systems, computer-supported cooperative work, and cognitive systems engineering. \{STSE\} bridges the traditional gap between organisational change and system development using two main types of activity: sensitisation and awareness; and constructive engagement.

This software metric is used to quantify the evolution of the stability vs. maintainability of the software through various releases. It is demonstrated that the classes in the software graph are acquiring more out-going calls than incoming calls as the software ages. Three examples of software applications where maintainability and continuous refactoring are an inherent part of their development process are presented, in addition to a Sun Java2 framework where growth and backward compatibility are the more important factors for the development. Further to this a projected future evolution of the software structure and maintainability is calculated.

Meanwhile design practitioners increasingly use methods from social sciences. Completing three design cases dealing with educational technology we have developed a human-centered research-based design methodology where software prototypes play an important role. Although the methodology builds on theories and methods from social sciences and educational research the context is design. Through analyses of the patterns identified in the cases we conceptualized the intentions of the methodology and created a model of an iterative research-based design process. Research-based design emphasizes serving users and the iterative process consists of four partly overlapping phases: contextual inquiry, participatory design, product design, and production of software as hypotheses. In the hermeneutic cycle all research and design operations increase researchers' and designers' understanding of the context and factors in all the phases.

The process is observed on two granularities: Granularity of software change (SC) and granularity of Solo Iterative Process (SIP). The experience confirms that both SC and SIP process models can be successfully enacted, are able to implement the described feature, and produced a high quality code in reasonable time. The lessons learned, particularly the exit criteria for SC phases, are discussed in more detail in the paper and may be applicable to team iterative processes, including agile processes."
2200.0,Excluded,ec3,Software characteristics of SOA projects,"Sufficient experience with implementing service-oriented architecture (SOA) has been accumulated so that the software characteristics of SOA implementations can be evaluated. The evaluation reported here considers four SOA implementation project situations: pilot implementations in the common form and in the classic form, and subsequent implementations in the common form and in the classic form. Since reductions in maintenance have been claimed as major SOA benefits, the evaluation reported here focuses on maintenance characteristics as described in the standards of the IEEE and the International Standards Organization."
2201.0,Excluded,ec7,Software Design and Architecture The once and future focus of software engineering,"The design of software has been a focus of software engineering research since the field's beginning. This paper explores key aspects of this research focus and shows why design will remain a principal focus. The intrinsic elements of software design, both process and product, are discussed: concept formation, use of experience, and means for representation, reasoning, and directing the design activity. Design is presented as being an activity engaged by a wide range of stakeholders, acting throughout most of a system's lifecycle, making a set of key choices which constitute the application's architecture. Directions for design research are outlined, including: (a) drawing lessons, inspiration, and techniques from design fields outside of computer science, (b) emphasizing the design of application ""character"" (functionality and style) as well as the application's structure, and (c) expanding the notion of software to encompass the design of additional kinds of intangible complex artifacts."
2202.0,Excluded,ec7,Software design and engineering as a social process,"Traditionally, software engineering processes are based on a formalist model that emphasizes strict documentation, procedural and validation standards. Although this is a poor fit for multidisciplinary research and development communities, such groups can benefit from common practices and standards. We have approached this dilemma through a process model derived from theories of collaborative work rather than formal process control. This paper describes this model and our experiences in applying it in software development."
2203.0,Excluded,ec7,Software design and media design: tools to design mobile and sensory interfaces and interactive environments,"This paper discusses ETAG, a formalism for user interface design. We discuss the differences between computer software and media product design: media design is a much more flexible, iterative process and prototype-driven process which allows for continuous adaptation of the design.. Finally, to meet user requirements in ubiquitous computing and interactive environments, we propose to use co-design practices, sensory labs and living labs to push the usability lab into the real world."
2204.0,Excluded,ec7,Software design sketching with calico,"Despite the availability of a host of software design notations and associated tools, software developers are known to frequently turn to the whiteboard when faced with a specific design problem. There, they typically engage in an informal form of software design that relies heavily on sketching. However, whereas whiteboards afford flexibility and fluidity, they at the same time limit a designer in only being able to draw and erase content. This paper presents Calico, a novel software design tool that leverages electronic whiteboards to enhance the design experience with explicit support for the creative, exploratory aspects of design. Specifically, Calico offers a grid, scraps, and a palette together with gesture-based input to address several natural behaviors exhibited by software designers, including frequent shifts in focus, use of low-detail models, and use of a mix of notations. To evaluate Calico, we performed a laboratory experiment involving eight pairs of graduate students and collected and analyzed six corporate design sessions that employed Calico. Results are promising and indicate the benefits of Calico, while they at the same time highlight several ways in which it can be enhanced."
2205.0,Excluded,ec7,Software Development Environments for Scientific and Engineering Software: A Series of Case Studies,"The need for high performance computing applications for computational science and engineering projects is growing rapidly, yet there have been few detailed studies of the software engineering process used for these applications. The DARPA High Productivity Computing Systems Program has sponsored a series of case studies of representative computational science and engineering projects to identify the steps involved in developing such applications (i.e. the life cycle, the workflows, technical challenges, and organizational challenges). Secondary goals were to characterize tool usage and identify enhancements that would increase the programmers' productivity. Finally, these studies were designed to develop a set of lessons learned that can be transferred to the general computational science and engineering community to improve the software engineering process used for their applications. Nine lessons learned from five representative projects are presented, along with their software engineering implications, to provide insight into the software development environments in this domain."

While the first workshop in 2008 focused on the definitions of the concepts involved in software development governance, the second workshop focused on case studies in which changes are introduced to software teamwork, e.g., distributed and agile environments, and on governance approaches that are used to better align software development with the business goals."
2209.0,Excluded,ec7,Software development lifecycle models,"This history column article provides a tour of the main software development life cycle (SDLC) models. (A lifecycle covers all the stages of software from its inception with requirements definition through to fielding and maintenance.) System development lifecycle models have drawn heavily on software and so the two terms can be used interchangeably in terms of SDLC, especially since software development in this respect encompasses software systems development. Because the merits of selecting and using an SDLC vary according to the environment in which software is developed as well as its application, I discuss three broad categories for consideration when analyzing the relative merits of SDLC models. I consider the waterfall model before the other models because it has had a profound effect on software development, and has additionally influenced many SDLC models prevalent today. Thereafter, I consider some of the mainstream models and finish with a discussion of what the future could hold for SDLC models."
2210.0,Excluded,ec3,Software development methods and usability: Perspectives from a survey in the software industry in Norway,"This paper investigates the relationship between software development methodologies and usability. The point of departure is the assumption that two important disciplines in software development, one of software development methods (SDMs) and one of usability work, are not integrated in industrial software projects. Building on previous research we investigate two questions; (1) Will software companies generally acknowledge the importance of usability, but not prioritise it in industrial projects? and (2) To what degree are software development methods and usability perceived by practitioners as being integrated? To this end a survey in the Norwegian \{IT\} industry was conducted. From a sample of 259 companies we received responses from 78 companies. In response to our first research question, our findings show that although there is a positive bias towards usability, the importance of usability testing is perceived to be much less than that of usability requirements. Given the strong time and cost pressures associated with the software industry, we believe that these results highlight that there is a gap between intention and reality. Regarding our second research question our survey revealed that companies perceive usability and software development methods to be integrated. This is in contrast to earlier research, which, somewhat pessimistically, has argued for the existence of two different cultures, one of software development and one of usability. The findings give hope for the future, in particular because the general use of system development methods are pragmatic and adaptable."
2211.0,Excluded,ec3,Software development team flexibility antecedents,"The ability to respond to changes in the environment during the development of software is crucial in achieving a quality product. Putting the project team together to achieve the ability to react effectively requires an understanding of the nature of flexibility and capabilities that might promote the ability to respond to changing requirements and conditions. Based on dynamic capability theory, we build a model of software quality that is dependent on the flexibility of the team, with the flexibility of the team dependent on reactive and anticipatory capabilities of the team members. A questionnaire administered to 119 software development team members indicates strong linkages from reactive capabilities and mixed results for anticipatory capabilities to team flexibility. Both flexibility components of a comprehensive response and efficient response to changes are critical in achieving quality software. The items comprising the capabilities can serve to guide management in building flexible development teams."
2212.0,Excluded,ec3,Software development: arts & crafts or math & science?,"We've have been proposing formal mathematical methods of software development for nearly as long as we've been developing software. CASE tools were a bust, and Gödel long ago nullified any hope of building a system that is both complete and consistent. Model-driven development gets trotted out in a new outfit once every decade as the next ""silver bullet,"" but we're still far from drawing pictures that generate code. Test-driven development almost produces executable specifications, but there's nothing mathematical or provably correct about them. Quality assurance happens during coding, but there's nothing to ensure that the entire system gets built, or that it's what the customer wants. Agile methods propose ""emergent design,"" where BDUF (big design up front) is old-fashioned and limiting. But agile methods work best with small groups of clever people to implement them; they have a hard time scaling. The open-source movement, in which hobbyist programmers write code simply for the love of programming, has produced some of the best software in the industry. Is it good because people love what they're doing and build it for themselves to use? Or is it good because there are hundreds of eyes on the code? Is software development a science or an art? Does it depend on mathematicians or on craftspeople? Are these viewpoints reconcilable?"
2213.0,Excluded,ec3,Software effort estimation terminology: The tower of Babel,"It is well documented that the software industry suffers from frequent cost overruns. A contributing factor is, we believe, the imprecise estimation terminology in use. A lack of clarity and precision in the use of estimation terms reduces the interpretability of estimation accuracy results, makes the communication of estimates difficult, and lowers the learning possibilities. This paper reports on a structured review of typical software effort estimation terminology in software engineering textbooks and software estimation research papers. The review provides evidence that the term â€˜effort estimateâ€™ is frequently used without sufficient clarification of its meaning, and that estimation accuracy is often evaluated without ensuring that the estimated and the actual effort are comparable. Guidelines are suggested on how to reduce this lack of clarity and precision in terminology."

2217.0,Excluded,ec3,Software engineering course design for undergraduates,"Software Engineering course design for undergraduates has been a challenging task in many campuses, especially for those that do not have large enrollment. This is not only because the course has too many topics to be covered in one semester, even two semesters, but also because it crosses many different disciplines such as computer science, engineering, management, and staffing. In this paper, a course framework is designed for the undergraduate software engineering in a context with small enrollment in terms of the Software Engineering core and elective requirements in CC2001 [1] as well as ABET 2010 [2] and SE2004 [3]. Based on the author's experience, the course design decisions are made against the dimensions presented in [4]. The topics covered in the course design as well as the course curriculum are presented. Activities and requirements of term-long team projects are illustrated to reflect the topics covered in the lecture and synchronized with the lecture progressing."
2218.0,Excluded,ec3,Software engineering education: A study on conducting collaborative senior project development,"Project and teamwork training is recognized as an important aspect in software engineering (SE) education. Senior projects, which often feature industrial involvement, serve the function of a â€˜capstone courseâ€™ in \{SE\} curricula, by offering comprehensive training in collaborative software development. Given the characteristics of student team projects and the social aspects of software development, instructional issues in such a course must include: how to encourage teamwork, how to formalize and streamline stakeholder participation, and how to monitor studentsâ€™ work, as well as sustain their desired collaborative effort throughout the development. In this paper, we present an exploratory study which highlights a particular case and introduces the meetings-flow approach. In order to investigate how this approach could contribute to the project's results, we examined its quantitative benefits in relation to the development of the project. We also conducted focus group interviews to discuss the humanistic findings and educational effects pertaining to this approach."

2221.0,Excluded,ec3,Software engineering senior design course: experiences with agile game development in a capstone project,"The importance of capstone senior design project courses is widely recognized for undergraduate software engineering curricula. They provide students with an opportunity to integrate and apply theoretical knowledge (both from previous courses and newly acquired for the project) on a team, improving both their technical and soft-skills. Here, we report our experiences using an agile development method for a game project; this is a radical shift from our previous course offerings that were based on waterfall, model driven development. This report is unique and valuable, especially for software engineering education, which goes beyond the discipline-specific limits of computer science curricula."
2222.0,Excluded,ec3,Software engineering team studios,"Training of students on software engineering methods and practices demands more than the development of a project by a team. It demands effective training and monitoring on the software process, process tracking and team dynamics. Furthermore, lack of a dedicated space for team activities acerbates software development by teams and does not foster team effectiveness. We established a set of Software Engineering Team Studios with the vision to provide an environment in which to bring to focus issues that arise in the development of software by teams and which allows us to put into practice lessons learned in the classroom on software engineering methods and best practices."
2223.0,Excluded,ec7,Software evolution and the moving picture metaphor,Software systems evolve over time. Currently we do not do a good job of documenting this evolution. This essay discusses the need to better document software evolution and introduces the Moving Picture Metaphor. Source Control Management systems are more like collections of still photographs than moving pictures. Still photography is not ideal when trying to capture evolutional changes. Moving pictures do a much better job. A storyteller can use moving pictures to tell compelling stories that are easier to digest than traditional documentation. We can learn a great deal from watching stories that document a system's evolution.
2224.0,Excluded,ec3,Software evolution and the staged model of the software lifecycle,"Software maintenance is concerned with modifying software once it has been delivered and has entered user service. Many studies have shown that maintenance is the dominant lifecycle activity for most practical systems; thus maintenance is of enormous industrial and commercial importance. Over the past 25 years or so, a conventional view of software development and maintenance has been accepted in which software is produced, delivered to the user, and then enters a maintenance stage. A review of this approach and the state of the art in research and practice is given at the start of the chapter. In most lifecycle models, software maintenance is lumped together as one phase at the end. In the experience of the authors, based on how maintenance is really undertaken (rather than how it might or should be done), software maintenance actually consists of a number of stages, some of which can start during initial development. This provides a very different perspective on the lifecycle. In the chapter, we introduce a new model of the lifecycle that partitions the conventional maintenance phase in a much more useful, relevant, and constructive way. It is termed the staged model. There are five stages through which the software and the development team progress. A project starts with initial development stage, and we then identify an explicit evolution stage. Next is a servicing stage, comprising simple tactical activities. Later still, the software moves to a phase-out stage in which no more work is done on the software other than to collect revenue from its use. Finally the software has a close-down stage. The key point is that software evolution is quite different and separate from servicing, from phase-out, and from close-down, and this distinction is crucial in clarifying both the technical and business consequences. We show how the new model can provide a coherent analytic approach to preserving software value. Finally, promising research areas are summarized."
2225.0,Excluded,ec3,Software evolution in agile development: a case study,"The agile development method (ADM) is characterized by continuous feedback and change, and a software system developed using ADMevolves continuously through short iterations. Empirical studies on evolution of software following agile development method have been sparse. Most studies on software evolution have been performed on systems built using traditional (waterfall) development methods or using the open source development approach. This paper summarizes our study on the evolution of an enterprise software system following ADM. We evaluated key characteristics of evolution in the light of Lehman's laws of software evolution dealing with continuous change and growth, self-regulation and conservation, increasing complexity and declining quality. Our study indicates that most laws of evolution are followed by the system. We also present our observations on agile practices such as collective code ownership, test driven development and collaboration when the team is distributed."

However, it might be possible to predict the future of software for the next decade based on the current trends. And based on the predictions on future of software, it might be possible to speculate about the future of software engineering. I try to do such a prediction in this position paper. I predict that the future of software will be applications that will be accessible everywhere, such as web applications and mobile applications. I also predict that increasingly more applications will be developed by non-computer-scientists. The challenges and the opportunities for software engineering research will be in providing tools and techniques that will enable non-programmers to become programmers for everywhere-accessible-software."

2229.0,Excluded,ec3,Software Organizations and Test Process Development,"Abstract In this study, the components important for testing work and organizational test process are identified and analyzed. This work focuses on the testing activities in real-life software organizations, identifying the important test process components, observing testing work in practice, and analyzing how the organizational test process could be developed. Software professionals from 14 different software organizations were interviewed in several phases to collect data on organizational test process and testing-related factors. Moreover, additional data on organizational aspects were collected with a survey conducted on 31 organizations. These data were further analyzed with the Grounded Theory method to identify the important test process components, and to observe how real-life test organizations develop their testing activities. The test management at the project level is an important factor; the organizations do have sufficient test resources available, but they are not necessarily applied efficiently. In addition, organizations in general are reactive; they develop their process mainly to correct problems, not to enhance their efficiency or output quality. The results of this study allows organizations to have a better understanding of the test processes, and develop toward better practices and a culture of preventing problems, not reacting to them."
2230.0,Excluded,ec3,Software pattern communities: current practices and challenges,"Software pattern designers and users have few resources available to support pattern-based development practices. Patterns are currently disseminated in disjoint collections in various publishing mediums with little or no technology support. As the number of patterns and diversity of pattern types continue to proliferate, pattern users and developers are faced with difficulties of understanding what patterns already exist and when, where, and how to use or reference them properly. This defeats the very purpose of patterns as a medium to encapsulate and disseminate recurring design experiences. In this paper, an initial study among a set of pattern collections is performed to better understand the difficulties related to improve pattern-based support for software development activities. Based on the empirical survey, challenges are identified that define impediments to the federation of software patterns into an interconnected body of knowledge. A Semantic Web ontology is presented as an initial attempt at solving some of these issues through the use of Web-based ontologies."

2232.0,Excluded,ec3,Software Process Improvement as organizational change: A metaphorical analysis of the literature,"Software Process Improvement (SPI) typically involves rather complex organizational changes. Acknowledging that managers can approach these changes in quite different ways, this paper addresses the following question: what perspectives do the research literature offer on \{SPI\} as organizational change and how is this knowledge presented and published? To answer this question, we analyzed \{SPI\} research publications with a main emphasis on organizational change using Gareth Morgan's organizational metaphors (1996) as analytical lenses. In addition, we characterized each article along the following dimensions: knowledge orientation (normative versus descriptive), theoretical emphasis (high versus low), main audience (practitioner versus academic), geographical origin (Scandinavia, the Americas, Europe, or the Asia-Pacific), and publication level (high versus low ranked journal). The review demonstrates that the literature as a whole is firmly grounded in both theory and practice, it appropriately targets both practitioner and academic audiences, and Scandinavian and American researchers are the main contributors. However, the distribution of articles across Morgan's metaphors is uneven and reveals knowledge gaps that present new avenues for research. The current literature offers important insights into organizational change in \{SPI\} when viewed through machine, organism, flux and transformation, and brain metaphors. Practitioners may use these articles to guide \{SPI\} initiatives. In contrast, the impact of culture, dominance, psychic prison, and politics in \{SPI\} has only received scant attention. We argue that these perspectives could offer important additional insights into the challenges involved in managing SPI. Researchers are therefore advised to engage in new \{SPI\} research based on one or more of these perspectives. Overall, the paper offers research directions and management lessons, and it provides a roadmap to help identify insights and specific articles related to \{SPI\} as organizational change."

Objective The primary objective of this paper is to identify software process improvement (SPI) success factors for small and medium Web companies. Method To achieve this goal, we conducted semi-structured, open-ended interviews with 21 participants representing 11 different companies in Pakistan, and analyzed the data qualitatively using the Glaserian strand of grounded theory research procedures. The key steps of these procedures that were employed in this research included open coding, focused coding, theoretical coding, theoretical sampling, constant comparison, and scaling up. Results An initial framework of key \{SPI\} success factors for small and medium Web companies was proposed, which can be of use for small and medium Web companies engaged in SPI. The paper also differentiates between small and medium Web companies and analyzes crucial \{SPI\} requirements for companies operating in the Web development domain. Conclusion The results of this work, in particular the use of qualitative techniques â€“ allowed us to obtain rich insight into \{SPI\} success factors for small and medium Web companies. Future work comprises the validation of the \{SPI\} success factors with small and medium Web companies."
2235.0,Included,included,Software process improvement through the Lean Measurement (SPI-LEAM) method,"Software process improvement methods help to continuously refine and adjust the software process to improve its performance (e.g., in terms of lead-time, quality of the software product, reduction of change requests, and so forth). Lean software development propagates two important principles that help process improvement, namely identification of waste in the process and considering interactions between the individual parts of the software process from an end-to-end perspective. A large shift of thinking about the own way of working is often required to adopt lean. One of the potential main sources of failure is to try to make a too large shift about the ways of working at once. Therefore, the change to lean has to be done in a continuous and incremental way. In response to this we propose a novel approach to bring together the quality improvement paradigm and lean software development practices, the approach being called Software Process Improvement through the Lean Measurement (SPI-LEAM) Method. The method allows to assess the performance of the development process and take continuous actions to arrive at a more lean software process over time. The method is under implementation in industry and an initial evaluation of the method has been performed."

Recent studies that have attempted to bring software process into the classroom have focused mainly on agile methodologies. Few if any studies have compared multiple paradigms. The current research compared the use of the Rational Unified Process (RUP) and eXtreme Programming (XP) paradigms by teams of students developing projects to satisfy the same user requirements. We found that all teams understood their assigned paradigms, but the RUP teams were more successful in applying the methodology. On the other hand, the RUP teams were significantly more likely to claim that they would have preferred to use XP rather than their assigned process."
2238.0,Included,included,Software product line scoping and requirements engineering in a small and medium-sized enterprise: An industrial case study,"Abstract Software product line (SPL) engineering has been applied in several domains, especially in large-scale software development. Given the benefits experienced and reported, \{SPL\} engineering has increasingly garnered interest from small to medium-sized companies. It is possible to find a wide range of studies reporting on the challenges of running a \{SPL\} project in large companies. However, very little reports exist that consider the situation for small to medium-sized enterprises and these studies try develop universal truths for \{SPL\} without lessons learned from empirical evidence need to be contextualized. This study is a step towards bridging this gap in contextual evidence by characterizing the weaknesses discovered in the scoping (SC) and requirements (RE) disciplines of SPL. Moreover, in this study we conducted a case study in a small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs) to justify the use of agile methods when introducing the \{SPL\} \{SC\} and \{RE\} disciplines through the characterization of their bottlenecks. The results of the characterization indicated that ineffective communication and collaboration, long iteration cycles, and the absence of adaptability and flexibility can increase the effort and reduce motivation during project development. These issues can be mitigated by agile methods."

2242.0,Excluded,ec3,Software quality across borders: Three case studies on company internal alignment,"AbstractContext Software quality issues are commonly reported when offshoring software development. Value-based software engineering addresses this by ensuring key stakeholders have a common understanding of quality. Objective This work seeks to understand the levels of alignment between key stakeholder groups within a company on the priority given to aspects of software quality developed as part of an offshoring relationship. Furthermore, the study aims to identify factors impacting the levels of alignment identified. Method Three case studies were conducted, with representatives of key stakeholder groups ranking aspects of software quality in a hierarchical cumulative exercise. The results are analysed using Spearman rank correlation coefficients and inertia. The results were discussed with the groups to gain a deeper understanding of the issues impacting alignment. Results Various levels of alignment were found between the various groups. The reasons for misalignment were found to include cultural factors, control of quality in the development process, short-term versus long-term orientations, understanding of cost-benefits of quality improvements, communication and coordination. Conclusions The factors that negatively affect alignment can vary greatly between different cases. The work emphasises the need for greater support to align company internal success-critical stakeholder groups in their understanding of quality when offshoring software development."
2243.0,Included,included,Software quality and agile methods,"Agile methods may produce software faster but we also need to know how they meet our quality requirements. In this paper we compare the waterfall model with agile processes to show how agile methods achieve software quality under time pressure and in an unstable requirements environment, i.e. we analyze agile software quality assurance. We present a detailed waterfall model showing its software quality support processes. We then show the quality practices that agile methods have integrated into their processes. This allows us to answer the question ""Can agile methods ensure quality even though they develop software faster and can handle unstable requirements?"" Â© 2004 IEEE."
2244.0,Included,included,Software quality and assurance in waterfall model and XP - A comparative study,"Dealing with an increasingly volatile organizational environment is a serious challenge for managers of any software development. Traditional formal software development methodologies can be characterized as reflecting linear, sequential processes, and the related management approaches, and be effective in development software with stable, known, consistent requirements. Yet most real-world development efforts are much more likely to be conducted in more volatile environments, as organizations adapt to changing technology, markets, and social conditions. Requirements for systems must be able to change right along with them, often at ""Internet speed"" [1]. Project management approaches based on the traditional linear development methodologies are mismatched with such dynamic systems. The support of software quality in a software development process may be regarded under two aspects: first, by providing techniques, which support the development of high quality software and second, by providing techniques, which assure the required quality attributes in existing artifacts. Both approaches have to be combined to achieve effective and successful software engineering [2]. Agile methods may produce software faster but we also need to know how they meet our quality requirements. In this paper we compare the waterfall model with agile processes to show how agile methods achieve software quality under time pressure and in an unstable requirements environment, i.e. we analyze agile software quality assurance. We present a detailed waterfall model showing its software quality support processes. We then show the quality practices that agile methods have integrated into their processes. This allows us to answer the question ""Can agile methods ensure quality even though they develop software faster and can handle unstable requirements""?"

To contribute to increase of net income, a quality assurance organization has to consider cost and value of the testware involved in assuring quality of software artifacts, such as requirements, specifications, designs, and code. Objective This paper proposes a set of economic metrics: testware return on investment, inflation, and cost and value sensitivity to artifact changes and time passage. The paper proposes a set of guidelines on lowering testware cost, on increasing value, on maximizing return on investment, and on when to release. Method This paper presents an industrial case study data on the relation between test case cost and value, and on cost and value sensitivity to time passage and artifact changes. Results The industrial case study showed return on investment on test cases of up to 200%, deflation of up to âˆ’2% per month, undesirable economic effects, such as test case cost outpacing test case value and rapid test case value depreciation based on time passage. Conclusion A viable \{QA\} organization should measure and improve test case return on investment, inflation, and cost and value sensitivity to artifact changes and time passage."
2247.0,Included,included,Software Quality Assurance in XP and Spiral - A Comparative Study,"Agile processes have been introduced to avoid the problems most of software practitioners have run up against by using traditional software development methodologies. These are well known for their benefits like focus on quality, early business value delivery, higher morale of stakeholders, and the reduced cost/schedule. Also, they can support the earlier and quicker production of the code by dividing the product into small segments called iterations. However, there are on-going debates about their flexibility to accommodate changing requirements and whether the productivity and quality of the agile processes is satisfactory for the customers or not. Previously available studies have mostly focused on comparing XP(eXtreme Programming) with some other agile methodologies, rather than comparing it with traditional plan-driven software development methodologies. In this paper, we identify the XP phases and practices, how they ensure product quality, and map XP phases against the Spiral model phases to prove that XP has built-in QA (quality assurance) practices in its life cycle, in addition to its focus on productivity. A case study is also included to empirically investigate quality of the product developed using XP with comparison to the product developed using Spiral model."

2250.0,Excluded,ec3,Software release planning: an evolutionary and iterative approach,"To achieve higher flexibility and to better satisfy actual customer requirements, there is an increasing tendency to develop and deliver software in an incremental fashion. In adopting this process, requirements are delivered in releases and so a decision has to be made on which requirements should be delivered in which release. Three main considerations that need to be taken account of are the technical precedences inherent in the requirements, the typically conflicting priorities as determined by the representative stakeholders, as well as the balance between required and available effort. The technical precedence constraints relate to situations where one requirement cannot be implemented until another is completed or where one requirement is implemented in the same increment as another one. Stakeholder preferences may be based on the perceived value or urgency of delivered requirements to the different stakeholders involved. The technical priorities and individual stakeholder priorities may be in conflict and difficult to reconcile. This paper provides (i) a method for optimally allocating requirements to increments; (ii) a means of assessing and optimizing the degree to which the ordering conflicts with stakeholder priorities within technical precedence constraints; (iii) a means of balancing required and available resources for all increments; and (iv) an overall method called \{EVOLVE\} aimed at the continuous planning of incremental software development. The optimization method used is iterative and essentially based on a genetic algorithm. A set of the most promising candidate solutions is generated to support the final decision. The paper evaluates the proposed approach using a sample project."

This paper describes an investigation of the informative efficacy of a taxonomy of requirements change sources which distinguishes between changes arising from `market', `organisation', `project vision', `specification' and `solution'. This investigation was effected through a case study where change data was recorded over a 16 month period covering the development lifecycle of a government sector software application. While insufficiency of data precluded an investigation of changes arising due to the change source of `market', for the remainder of the change sources, results indicate a significant difference in cost, value to the customer and management considerations. Findings show that higher cost and value changes arose more often from `organisation' and `vision' sources; these changes also generally involved the co-operation of more stakeholder groups and were considered to be less controllable than changes arising from the `specification' or `solution' sources. Overall, the results suggest that monitoring and measuring change using this classification is a practical means to support change management, understanding and risk visibility."

Applying a deconstructionist analysis to methods reveals that there are two texts, or sets of assumptions and ideals: a set that is privileged by the method and a second set that is left out, or marginalized by the method. We apply this analytical lens to software reuse, a technique in software development that seeks to expedite one's own project by using programming artifacts created by others. By analyzing the methods prescribed by Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE), we arrive at two texts: Methodical CBSE and Amethodical Remixing. Empirical data from four studies on code search on the web draws attention to four key points of tension: status of component boundaries; provenance of source code; planning and process; and evaluation criteria for candidate code. We conclude the paper with a discussion of the implications of this work for the limits of methods, structure of organizations that reuse software, and the design of search engines for source code."

To rationalize, these existing software assets should be integrated, in the sense that similar features should be implemented only once. The integration can be achieved in different ways. Success of it involves properly managing challenges such as making as well founded decisions as early as possible, maintaining commitment within the organization, managing the complexities of distributed teams, and synchronizing the integration efforts with concurrent evolution of the existing systems.

The number of software project management antipatterns that appears in the literature and the Web increases to the extent that makes using antipatterns problematic. Furthermore, antipatterns are usually inter-related and rarely appear in isolation. As a result, detecting which antipatterns exist in a software project is a challenging task which requires expert knowledge. This paper proposes SPARSE, an \{OWL\} ontology based knowledge-based system that aims to assist software project managers in the antipattern detection process. The antipattern ontology documents antipatterns and how they are related with other antipatterns through their causes, symptoms and consequences. The semantic relationships that derive from the antipattern definitions are determined using the Pellet \{DL\} reasoner and they are transformed into the \{COOL\} language of the \{CLIPS\} production rule engine. The purpose of this transformation is to create a compact representation of the antipattern knowledge, enabling a set of object-oriented \{CLIPS\} production rules to run and retrieve antipatterns relevant to some initial symptoms. \{SPARSE\} is exemplified through 31 \{OWL\} ontology antipattern instances of software development antipatterns that appear on the Web."

Due to the intrinsic vagueness of speculative language, speculative requirements risk being misunderstood, and related uncertainty overlooked, and may benefit from careful treatment in the requirements engineering process. In this paper, we present a linguistically-oriented approach to automatic detection of uncertainty in natural language (NL) requirements. Our approach comprises two stages. First we identify speculative sentences by applying a machine learning algorithm called Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to identify uncertainty cues. The algorithm exploits a rich set of lexical and syntactic features extracted from requirements sentences. Second, we try to determine the scope of uncertainty. We use a rule-based approach that draws on a set of hand-crafted linguistic heuristics to determine the uncertainty scope with the help of dependency structures present in the sentence parse tree. We report on a series of experiments we conducted to evaluate the performance and usefulness of our system."

It will allow users to input their resource needs and provide them with matching cloud services. Additionally, in case these are not met, they can be communicated as new requirements to cloud providers. Such a contribution will improve the requirements communication and resource identification in cloud systems, bridging the gap between consumers and providers."

2281.0,Excluded,ec3,Standardisation: A tool for addressing market failure within the software industry,"Abstract Despite the maturity of the software industry, empirical research demonstrates that average software quality, when measured through the presence of software defects, is low. Such defects cause a wide array of issues, not least in the form of vulnerabilities, which support a multi-billion pound a year industry of fraud in cyber crime. This paper suggests that this is the result of market failure stemming from two factors: the first is that information asymmetry prevents the establishment of software quality prior to purchase; whilst the second is that the legal provisions available under private law are unable in their current form to adequately address software liability issues. On that basis this paper proposes the use of standardisation as a tool to address both of these shortcomings by providing an industry benchmark against which software quality can be ascertained, as well as forming a legal tool for determining causation for the purposes of establishing legal liability."

2283.0,Excluded,ec7,Stateful Requirements Monitoring for Self-Repairing Socio-Technical Systems," Socio-technical systems consist of human, hardware and software components that work in tandem to fulfill stakeholder requirements. By their very nature, such systems operate under uncertainty as components fail, humans act in unpredictable ways, and the environment of the system changes. Self-repair refers to the ability of such systems to restore fulfillment of their requirements by relying on monitoring, reasoning, and diagnosing on the current state of individual requirements. Self-repair is complicated by the multi-agent nature of socio-technical systems, which demands that requirements monitoring and self-repair be done in a decentralized fashion. In this paper, we propose a stateful requirements monitoring approach by maintaining an instance of a state machine for each requirement, represented as a goal, with runtime monitoring and compensation capabilities. By managing the interactions between the state machines, our approach supports hierarchical goal reasoning in both upward and downward directions. We have implemented a customizable Java framework that supports experimentation by simulating a socio-technical system. Results from our experiments suggest effective and precise support for a wide range of self-repairing decisions in a socio-technical setting."

2286.0,Excluded,ec5,Static composition of refactorings,"The number of possible refactorings is unlimited, so no tool vendor will ever be able to provide custom refactorings for all specific user needs. Therefore, we propose a new kind of refactoring tools, which allow users to create, edit and compose required refactorings just like any other documents. The heart of such a refactoring editor is the ability to compose larger refactorings from existing ones. Computing the precondition of the composite refactoring from the preconditions of the composed refactorings is non-trivial since earlier transformations influence the truth of preconditions of later ones. The ability to calculate these effects without referring to a particular program to which the refactorings should be applied is called program-independent composition. It is the prerequisite for creating composite refactorings that are reusable on arbitrary programs. The main contribution of this paper is a formal model for automatic, program-independent composition of conditional program transformations. We show that conditional transformations, including refactorings, can be composed from a limited set of basic operations. Program-independent derivation of a precondition for the composite is based on the notion of â€œtransformation descriptionâ€�, which can be seen as a simplified, yet equally powerful, variant of Robertsâ€™ â€œpostconditionsâ€� (Practical analysis for refactoring, Ph.D. Thesis (1999)). Our approach simplifies the implementation of refactoring toolsâ€”only the basic operations and the ability for composition must be hard coded in a tool. As a proof of concept, we sketch a transformation framework that implements our approach (jConditioner) and, based on the framework, an experimental refactoring tool (ConTraCT) that includes the editing capabilities that motivated our work."

Software maintenance is vital and it requires more efforts and resources than development phase. There are fewer methods available for maintenance effort estimation. An iterative maintenance life cycle using extreme programming is a model for software maintenance based on agile methodology that uses \{RC\} stories as requirement artifacts. Agile methodology uses analogy and expert opinion based estimation techniques such as planning poker. But in software maintenance, historical data and experts may not be present or accurate. Therefore, a heuristic method is required for the calculation of maintenance efforts. In this paper, we propose a Software Maintenance Effort Estimation Model (SMEEM) for software maintenance estimation. The \{SMEEM\} technique uses story points to calculate the volume of maintenance and value adjustment factors that are affecting story points for effort estimation. The proposed model will be illustrated with various types of maintenance projects. The model generates accurate and effective results as compared to other software maintenance effort estimation models. This model is applicable only for agile and extreme programming based maintenance environment."

2299.0,Excluded,ec5,Structured and Unobtrusive Observation of Anonymous Users and Their Context for Requirements Elicitation," Today, people find themselves surrounded by IT systems in their everyday life. Often they are not even aware that they are interacting with an IT system. More and more of these systems are context adaptive. Requirements to such systems may change for various reasons: The context may fundamentally change when other systems are introduced. New trends and fashions may evolve. Operators need to react quickly to such changes if they want to keep their systems competitive. Traditional approaches to requirements elicitation start to fail in this situation: context adaptive systems serve many users with different profiles. In addition, users may be reluctant to participate in improving it. Thus, it is hard to establish a representative model of requirements. Furthermore, it is hard to capture the context of requirements by subsequent interviews. In this paper we present a systematical approach for requirements elicitation based on observing anonymous users. The interaction of users with the system is observed in the normal working context. Observation is based on assumptions on how interaction should take place. Deviations from these assumptions point to new requirements. Observing a large number of users leads to a quantitative map of requirements in context. Preliminary evaluation shows that the approach is promising. It allows efficient observation of many stakeholders and the derivation of new requirements."

At the University of Ljubljana Scrum has been systematically taught since 2009 in the framework of the software engineering capstone course. The paper describes the course content and analyzes results of the survey that was performed among students with the aim of identifying those practices that students perceive most important for the success of Scrum-based software projects. Students' opinions on 12 typical practices representing possible success factors are described and compared to opinions of professional developers in order to find out similarities and differences in their perceptions. Both groups of respondents identified team-work and communication among team members, as well as good communication with the Product Owner, most important. Students also stressed the importance of strict adherence to the notion of &#x201C;done&#x201D;, while professional developers ranked third Sprint Planning Meetings and maintenance of Sprint Backlog. Accuracy of user stories and velocity estimation was rated least important by both groups of respondents."

2316.0,Excluded,ec3,Successful extreme programming: Fidelity to the methodology or good teamworking?,"Context Developing a theory of agile technology, in combination with empirical work, must include assessing its performance effects, and whether all or some of its key ingredients account for any performance advantage over traditional methods. Given the focus on teamwork, is the agile technology what really matters, or do general team factors, such as cohesion, primarily account for a teamâ€™s success? Perhaps the more specific software engineering team factors, for example the agile development methodâ€™s collective ownership and code management, are decisive. Objective To assess the contribution of agile methodology, agile-specific team methods, and general team factors in the performance of software teams. Method We studied 40 small-scale software development teams which used Extreme Programming (XP). We measured (1) the teamsâ€™ adherence to \{XP\} methods, (2) their use of XP-specific team practices, and (3) standard team attributes, as well as the quality of the projectâ€™s outcomes. We used Williams et al.â€™s (2004a) [33] Shodan measures of \{XP\} methods, and regression analysis. Results All three types of variables are associated with the projectâ€™s performance. Teamworking is important but it is the XP-specific team factor (continuous integration, coding standards, and collective code ownership) that is significant. Only customer planning (release planning/planning game, customer access, short releases, and stand-up meeting) is positively related to performance. A negative relationship between foundations (automated unit tests, customer acceptance tests, test-first design, pair programming, and refactoring) is found and is moderated by craftsmanship (sustainable pace, simple design, and metaphor/system of names). Of the general team factors only cooperation is related to performance. Cooperation mediates the relationship between the XP-specific team factor and performance. Conclusion Client and team foci of the \{XP\} method are its critical active ingredients."
2317.0,Included,included,Successful product-based agile software development without onsite customer an industrial case study,"Software industry is increasingly using Agile Methods due to its benefits. However the way industry practices agile methods is some time divergent to the basic Agile Principles. For example customer involvement in the entire software development process is considered essential; but under certain conditions this requirement is not so critical. We have studied in detail such an adaptation by a large software company using Agile Method i.e. SCRUM. The organization develops software products using SCRUM; however, after initial development; they customize the product for their potential customer. At no time (during initial development or customization stage), real customer is present at the development site; but still their products are immensely successful in terms of number of products sold, and customer satisfaction. In the real world case study we have analyzed reasons for the success of the organization and have studied in detail the circumstances which obviate the need of readily available customer. The results show that, extensive domain knowledge, prior experience of the product and experienced workforce mitigate the need of onsite customer."

However Agile projects still use evaluation methods during the \{RFP\} stage that do not fulfill the flexibility mandated by the Agile manifesto. Current evaluation methods assume a single development alternative, and thus a fixed costâ€“benefit tradeoff. The proposed model provides a more realistic approach by relaxing this assumption. It assumes that a supplier can propose several different alternatives (Multi-Alternative Proposal) reflecting diverse potential cost-benefit tradeoffs. The model makes it possible to rank the suppliers of these Multi-Alternative Proposals at the \{RFP\} stage. The ideas behind the method combine concepts from both the Agile approach and Data Mining. Thus suppliers who provide multi-alternative proposals can be ranked in an objective, but very intuitive manner."

2332.0,Excluded,ec3,Supporting Program Comprehension in Agile with Links to User Stories,"Agile software development involves continuously making iterative and incremental changes to source code. When making changes, developers quickly focus on parts of code that they consider to be important, and sometimes miss other relevant parts. Therefore, tool support is needed to help developers locate conceptually related sections of code. In this paper, we present Zelda, a tool designed to work with Agile practices that captures and maintains links between high-level information and source code. We evaluated Zelda with a pilot study where subjects were required to make a change to a small web application (10 KLOCs). They were given a task description either on paper or in Zelda. We found that the Zelda Group made more accurate changes, were less likely to become disoriented, and were more willing to access additional information."
2333.0,Excluded,ec7,Supporting Requirements Traceability through Refactoring,"Modern traceability tools employ information retrieval (IR) methods to generate candidate traceability links. These methods track textual signs embedded in the system to establish relationships between software artifacts. However, as software systems evolve, new and inconsistent terminology finds its way into the system's taxonomy, thus corrupting its lexical structure and distorting its traceability tracks. In this paper, we argue that the distorted lexical tracks of the system can be systematically re-established through refactoring, a set of behavior-preserving transformations for keeping the system quality under control during evolution. To test this novel hypothesis, we investigate the effect of integrating various types of refactoring on the performance of requirements-to-code automated tracing methods. In particular, we identify the problems of missing, misplaced, and duplicated signs in software artifacts, and then examine to what extent refactorings that restore, move, and remove textual information can overcome these problems respectively. We conduct our experimental analysis using three datasets from different application domains. Results show that restoring textual information in the system has a positive impact on tracing. In contrast, refactorings that remove redundant information impact tracing negatively. Refactorings that move information among the system modules are found to have no significant effect. Our findings address several issues related to code and requirements evolution, as well as refactoring as a mechanism to enhance the practicality of automated tracing tools."

Our strategy, SURF, classifies the available channels and uses them efficiently to increase data dissemination reliability in multi-hop cognitive radio networks. The classification is done on the basis of primary radio unoccupancy and of the number of cognitive radio neighbors using the channels. Through extensive NS-2 simulations, we study the performance of \{SURF\} compared to four related approaches. Simulation results confirm that our approach is effective in selecting the best channels for efficient communication (in terms of less primary radio interference) and for highest dissemination reachability in multi-hop cognitive radio networks."

2349.0,Excluded,ec7,Survey and analysis on Security Requirements Engineering,"Security Requirements Engineering is a new research area in software engineering, with the realization that security must be analyzed early during the requirements phase. Many researchers are working in this area; however, there is a lack in security requirements treatment. The security requirements are one of the non-functional requirements, which act as constraints on functions of the system. Organizations are depending on information systems for communicating and sharing information. Thus, \{IT\} security is becoming central in fulfilling business goals, to guard assets and to create trustworthy systems. To develop systems with adequate security features, it is essential to capture the security requirements. In this paper, we present a view on Security Requirements, issues, types, Security Requirements Engineering (SRE) and methods. We analyzed and compared different methods and found that \{SQUARE\} and Security Requirements Engineering Process methods cover most of the important activities of SRE. The developers can adopt these \{SRE\} methods and easily identify the security requirements for software systems."
2350.0,Excluded,ec3,Survey of Agile Tool Usage and Needs," Today, little is known about what tools software companies are using to support their Agile methods and whether they are satisfied or dissatisfied with them. This is due to lack of objective surveys on the subject. The surveys that have been conducted so far are of a subjective nature and have mostly been performed by tool vendors. They are very limited in number and focus mainly on company structure and adherence to a specific Agile method rather than on tool usage and needs. For this reason, many companies have difficulties to choose appropriate tools to support their Agile process. One such company is the Swedish telecommunications giant Ericsson. To account for this lack of data, Ericsson commissioned us to conduct an independent survey focusing on the tool usage and needs as experienced by the Agile software community today. In this paper, we report on the results of our survey. The survey covers 121 responses from 120 different companies coming from 35 different countries. Our results show that the most satisfactory tool aspect is ease of use, whereas the least satisfactory one is lack of integration with other systems. Finally, our results provide a list of features that are most desired by the software companies today."

Responding to requirements changes is one of the principles of agile methodologies. In this paper we envision the seamless integration of automated verification techniques within agile methodologies, thanks to the support for incrementality. Incremental verification accommodates the changes that occur within the schedule of frequent releases of software agile processes. We propose a general approach to developing families of verifiers that can support incremental verification for different kinds of artifacts and properties. The proposed syntactic-semantic approach is rooted in operator precedence grammars and their support for incremental parsing. Incremental verification procedures are encoded as attribute grammars, whose incremental evaluation goes hand in hand with incremental parsing."

Objective This article explains the empirical method of and the results from systematic analyses and comparison of development performance and product quality of Incremental Process and Agile Process adapted in two projects of a middle-size, telecommunication software development company. The Incremental Process is an adaption of the Waterfall Model whereas the newly introduced Agile Process is a combination of the Unified Software Development Process, Extreme Programming, and Scrum. Method The method followed to perform the analyses and comparison is benefited from the combined use of qualitative and quantitative methods. It utilizes; \{GQM\} Approach to set measurement objectives, \{CMMI\} as the reference model to map the activities of the software development processes, and a pre-defined assessment approach to verify consistency of process executions and evaluate measure characteristics prior to quantitative analysis. Results The results of the comparison showed that the Agile Process had performed better than the Incremental Process in terms of productivity (79%), defect density (57%), defect resolution effort ratio (26%), test execution V&amp;V effectiveness (21%), and effort prediction capability (4%). These results indicate that development performance and product quality achieved by following the Agile Process was superior to those achieved by following the Incremental Process in the projects compared. Conclusion The acts of measurement, analysis, and comparison enabled comprehensive review of the two development processes, and resulted in understanding their strengths and weaknesses. The comparison results constituted objective evidence for organization-wide deployment of the Agile Process in the company."

Objective The aim of this on-going research is to provide an annotated catalogue of \{SLRs\} available to software engineering researchers and practitioners. This study updates our previous study using a broad automated search. Method We performed a broad automated search to find \{SLRs\} published in the time period 1st January 2004 to 30th June 2008. We contrast the number, quality and source of these \{SLRs\} with \{SLRs\} found in the original study. Results Our broad search found an additional 35 \{SLRs\} corresponding to 33 unique studies. Of these papers, 17 appeared relevant to the undergraduate educational curriculum and 12 appeared of possible interest to practitioners. The number of \{SLRs\} being published is increasing. The quality of papers in conferences and workshops has improved as more researchers use \{SLR\} guidelines. Conclusion \{SLRs\} appear to have gone past the stage of being used solely by innovators but cannot yet be considered a main stream software engineering research methodology.

A nationwide survey of systems analysts was conducted to assess what tasks are most important, what skills are most important in completing the tasks, and how the tasks and skills needed may have changed over the last decade. The most important tasks were those associated with traditional systems development, namely defining system scope, objectives, system requirements, as well as assessing the impact of systems and evaluating their performance. Analytical skills were considered the most important skills overall, followed by technical and communication skills. The least important skills overall were interpersonal skills.

2370.0,Included,included,Tailoring agility: Promiscuous pair story authoring and value calculation,"This chapter describes how a multi-national software organization created a business plan involving business units from eight countries that followed an agile way, after two previously failed attempts with traditional approaches. The case is told by the consultant who initiated implementation of agility into requirements gathering, estimation and planning processes in an international setting. The agile approach was inspired by XP, but then tailored to meet the peculiar requirements. Two innovations were critical. The first innovation was promiscuous pair story authoring, where user stories were written by two people (similarly to pair programming), and the pairing changed very often (as frequently as every 15-20 minutes) to achieve promiscuity and cater for diverse point of views. The second innovation was an economic value evaluation (and not the cost) which was attributed to stories. Continuous recalculation of the financial value of the stories allowed to assess the projects financial return. In this case implementation of agility in the international context allowed the involved team members to reach consensus and unanimity of decisions, vision and purpose.

2390.0,Excluded,ec3,Team building criteria in software projects: A mix-method replicated study,"Context The internal composition of a work team is an important antecedent of team performance and the criteria used to select team members play an important role in determining team composition. However, there are only a handful of empirical studies about the use of team building criteria in the software industry. Objective The goal of this article is to identify criteria used in industrial practice to select members of a software project team, and to look for relationships between the use of these criteria and project success. In addition, we expect to contribute with findings about the use of replication in empirical studies involving human factors in software engineering. Method Our research was based on an iterative mix-method, replication strategy. In the first iteration, we used qualitative research to identify team-building criteria interviewing software project managers from industry. Then, we performed a cross-sectional survey to assess the correlations of the use of these criteria and project success. In the second iteration, we used the results of a systematic mapping study to complement the set of team building criteria. Finally, we performed a replication of the survey research with variations to verify and improve the results. Results Our results showed that the consistent use team building criteria correlated significantly with project success, and the criteria related to human factors, such as personality and behavior, presented the strongest correlations. The results of the replication did not reproduce the results of the original survey with respect to the correlations between criteria and success goals. Nevertheless, the variations in the design and the difference in the sample of projects allowed us to conclude that the two results were compatible, increasing our confidence on the existence of the correlations. Conclusion Our findings indicated that carefully selecting team member for software teams is likely to positively influence the projects in which these teams participate. Besides, it seems that the type of development method used can moderate (increase or decrease) this influence. In addition, our study showed that the choice of sampling technique is not straightforward given the many interacting factors affecting this type of investigation."

The data which the paper discusses comes from interviews with people involved in the quality effort in four different companies. Our approach to data collection was to use semi-structured interviews and to encourage interviewees to talk about their experiences of quality management and software development in their own organizations. We analysed this data using discourse analysis, informed by ethnographic observation, and identified a number of themes, one of which was the tensions that exist around the adoption and evolution of SQMS. In this paper, we present and discuss our approach to discourse analysis and some results that illustrate the tensions we found. We hope, thereby, to demonstrate how software engineers may use a technique from the social sciences to better understand their own practices."

2409.0,Excluded,ec3,Test-driven web application development in Java,"Today, software availability as well as adaptability has a strong impact on application development. Together with the success of the Internet technology, it is often necessary to offer a web-based software solution. For Java development, J2EE builds a bridge from traditional towards web application development. Java Server Pages and Servlets allow the implementation of web sites with dynamic content. Anyway, it is still possible to apply well-tried programming paradigms, e.g. the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm. With regard to software quality as well as adaptability, application development is affected more and more by advanced testing techniques. Especially unit testing provides a powerful technique to develop new functionality as well as to extend and reuse existing parts. This is also strengthened by the success of agile processes that force test-driven development. From there, application code grows up with unit tests from scratch on. For Java, JUnit has become the defacto standard unit test environment. Nevertheless, test-driven web application development requires broadening the unit test approach. Considering the special requirements of web application development, both the scope of the unit tests as well as the JUnit framework itself have to be extended to enable a test-driven development. In this paper, we present an approach to customize the unit test cycle as well as the JUnit framework towards a test-driven web application development. Â© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003."

We advocate in this paper that testing when applying an agile method should not only start as soon as possible but should be one of the first activities and moreover it should be considered as a specification of the problem even at unit level. This is supported from the Formal Methods area where contributions can be found that put a formal base to the relationship between Test Cases and Requirements Specification. We postulate that test cases can be seeing as a good way of specifying system requirements. We review some results, especially from the field of Formal Methods that seems to support this contention.

2414.0,Excluded,ec3,The \{PERFECT\} Approach to Experience-Based Process Evolution,"Improvement game plansâ€”carefully defined, organized and managed sequences of process change activities based on standards, maturity models and best practicesâ€”are critical to a company's success. Also critical is the ability to evolve processes in response to precipitous, unpredictable changes to critical business-context factors such as financial goals, customer desires, personnel availability, and available process performance support technology. This chapter describes an approachâ€”PERFECTâ€”to process evolution resulting from many decades of experience in helping companiesâ€”of a variety of sizes and in many industry sectorsâ€”rationally, rapidly and incrementally evolve their processes, often but not necessarily in the context of an overall improvement game plan. The approach is based on a frameworkâ€”PEDALâ€”identifying twelve categories of activities comprising process evolution. Three Case Studies introduce the framework and process evolution approach and show their application across a wide variety of situations to evolving a company's processes through narrowly focused, short, overlapping process evolution exercises each addressing a set of tightly inter-related processes. Several important lessons learned are discussed, followed by a description of a variety of simple techniques and tools allowing process change agents to rationally describe, understand, learn from, plan and manage process evolution exercises. The chapter ends with a discussion of various improvements that should be made to the \{PERFECT\} process evolution approach and its underlying \{PEDAL\} framework."

2417.0,Excluded,ec7,The adaptation of test-driven software processes to industrial automation engineering,"Software components provide an increasing part of added value in automation systems and become more complex to construct and test. Test-driven development (TDD) of software systems has been successfully used for agile development of business software systems. Test cases guide the system implementation and can be executed automatically after software changes (continuous integration &amp; build strategy). However, TDD processes need to be adapted to control automation systems engineering, where real-world systems are challenging to model and to test automatically. In this paper we introduce an adapted TDD process from the business software engineering domain to industrial automation engineering. We identify a set of UML models that enable the systematic derivation of test cases. Based on an initial empirical study we evaluate the adapted TDD process based on an industrial use case to identify strength and limitation of this approach. Major results of the study were that UML models enabled effective test case derivation in the study context."
2419.0,Excluded,ec5,The agile approach in an undergraduate software engineering course project,"The rise in popularity of agile software development methodologies such as extreme programming (XP), crystal, DSDM and feature-driven development has opened an opportunity for the software engineering education community. How can one capitalize on the strengths of agile development models while still appealing to established software engineering practices? The typical introductory software engineering course makes use of a team-based project to reinforce software process activities. The project normally runs for one academic term during which students are led through life-cycle activities using a modified waterfall approach to software development. While useful in teaching software engineering process concepts, this approach limits the team's ability to utilize feedback from downstream process activities. It also limits the students' opportunity to understand process improvement from their own experiences. The ability to respond to project change is also dampened by the fact that teams do not have the time or resources in this format to modify, or refactor the design of a project component let alone incorporate a new or modified customer requirement. Agile methodologies promote an evolutionary approach to development using short incremental release cycles. We report on the experiences of conducting a team project in an introductory software engineering course using agile development techniques at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Teams have the opportunity to experience multiple iterations of the software engineering life cycle and evolve a product design that allows for discoveries made during implementation and through the introduction of changing customer requirements. The project integrates the concept of test-driven development. This agile technique addresses testing early in the development process and reinforces the value of unit testing. The incorporation of agile techniques is not only useful for students in an introductory course, but may also be applied to upper division software engineering courses."

2428.0,Excluded,ec3,The application of safe scrum to IEC 61508 certifiable software,"In order to develop a better understanding of the application of Scrum to IEC61508 certifiable software, we assessed the standard to see how Scrum could conform. Each section of part 3 of the standard was assigned one of the categories: (1) ""OK"" - no modification needed to Scrum or IEC61508, (2) ""?"" - need to be discussed, (3) ""Not OK"" - need adaptation of Scrum Based on our assessment we proposed the Safe Scrum where the main idea is separation of concerns. Everything that is not part of the software development process is kept outside Scrum and will thus not be influenced by our choice of paradigm. In Safe Scrum, all requirements are split into safety critical requirements and other requirements and inserted into separate product backlogs. We then did a new assessment where we took the Safe Scrum into consideration. We found 15 issues where we need changes in order to make the process acceptable to Scrum and the safety assessors: how to structure development, plan for validating safety, create, review, select, design and ensure safety, write requirements for module testing, and test and evaluate the outputs from the safety lifecycle The first part of our model consists of the IEC61508 steps of developing the environment description and the SSRS phases 1-4. These initial steps result in the initial requirements of the system that is to be developed and is the key input to the second part of the model - the Safe Scrum process. Using an iterative and incremental approach means that the project can be continuously re-planned based on recent product experience. Between the iterations, experience can be used to re-prioritize the product backlogs. This makes the process flexible. When the sprints are completed, a final RAMS validation will be done. Since most of the system has been incrementally validated during the sprints, we expect the final RAMS validation to be less extensive than when using other development paradigms. This will also help us to reduce the time and cost needed for certification. Copyright Â© (2012) by IAPSAM & ESRA."

2454.0,Excluded,ec3,The effectiveness of pair programming: A meta-analysis,"Several experiments on the effects of pair versus solo programming have been reported in the literature. We present a meta-analysis of these studies. The analysis shows a small significant positive overall effect of pair programming on quality, a medium significant positive overall effect on duration, and a medium significant negative overall effect on effort. However, between-study variance is significant, and there are signs of publication bias among published studies on pair programming. A more detailed examination of the evidence suggests that pair programming is faster than solo programming when programming task complexity is low and yields code solutions of higher quality when task complexity is high. The higher quality for complex tasks comes at a price of considerably greater effort, while the reduced completion time for the simpler tasks comes at a price of noticeably lower quality. We conclude that greater attention should be given to moderating factors on the effects of pair programming."

2462.0,Excluded,ec7,The essential components of software architecture design and analysis,"Architecture analysis and design methods such as ATAM, QAW, \{ADD\} and \{CBAM\} have enjoyed modest success and are being adopted by many companies as part of their standard software development processes. They are used in the lifecycle, as a means of understanding business goals and stakeholders concerns, mapping these onto an architectural representation, and assessing the risks associated with this mapping. These methods have evolved a set of shared component techniques. In this paper we show how these techniques can be combined in countless ways to create needs-specific methods in an agile way. We demonstrate the generality of these techniques by describing a new architecture improvement method called \{APTIA\} (Analytic Principles and Tools for the Improvement of Architectures). \{APTIA\} almost entirely reuses pre-existing techniques but in a new combination, with new goals and results. We exemplify APTIAâ€™s use in improving the architecture of a commercial information system."
2463.0,Excluded,ec3,The evolution of a production planning system: A 10-year case study,"This paper describes the evolution of a production planning system (PPS) from a simple work sequence generation tool to a useful, sustained scheduling system. Three stages of evolution are described. In the first stage, a Gantt chart sequencing tool was converted to a scheduler's information system. This change was driven by the need to support the scheduler's daily task. The second stage of evolution was caused by an MRPâ€“ERP conversion. The integration and conversion increased overhead and complexity in the job task and hence the tool, including the transformation of the previously integrated dispatching/scheduling task into separate dispatching and scheduling activities. The third stage of evolution has been small continuous improvements driven by management reporting requirements. \{PPS\} was developed in 1996 and has been fully operational since January 1997. Two major insights are discussed in this paper: the implications of supporting the scheduling task versus work sequence generation, and the software design requirements for evolutionary change as the software is used in an ever-changing situation."

Yet case studies do not support these assumptions. The authors had the opportunity to compare the productivity, quality and performance of collocated agile teams with distributed agile teams and found that the collocated teams perform substantially better. In the first case a collocated team was eight times more productive, while in the second case, transferring the work to a collocated team saved the project from certain disaster. From these examples and others, there are strong indications that companies should be rediscovering collocated project teams as the old/new paradigm for delivering real value for their IT projects"

Method We conducted a Grounded Theory study involving 30 Agile practitioners from 16 software development organizations in New Zealand and India, over a period of 3 years. Results We discovered that Lack of Customer Involvement was one of the biggest challenges faced by Agile teams. Customers were not as involved on these Agile projects as Agile methods demand. We describe the causes of inadequate customer collaboration, its adverse consequences on self-organizing Agile teams, and Agile Undercover â€” a set of strategies used by the teams to practice Agile despite insufficient or ineffective customer involvement.

These regulations often drive significant changes in the way organizations operate to deliver value to their customers. This paper focuses on the impact of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations on agile software development processes, which in many ways can be considered as just another type of organizational processes. Particular focus is placed on the ability for Extreme Programming (XP) to support FDA requirements. Findings show that XP fails to meet many of the FDA guidelines for medical device software, which increases the risks of non-compliance for organizations that have adopted XP as their main software process. The results of this study can lead the work towards designing an extension to XP for FDA regulations. Copyright Â© 2011, IGI Global."
2480.0,Excluded,ec7,The Impact of Requirements on Software Quality across Three Product Generations," In a previous case study, we presented data demonstrating the impact that a well-written and well-reviewed set of requirements had on software defects and other quality indicators between two generations of an Intel product. The first generation was coded from an unorganized collection of requirements that were reviewed infrequently and informally. In contrast, the second was developed based on a set of requirements stored in a Requirements Management database and formally reviewed at each revision. Quality indicators for the second software product all improved dramatically even with the increased complexity of the newer product. This paper will recap that study and then present data from a subsequent Intel case study revealing that quality enhancements continued on the third generation of the product. The third generation software was designed and coded using the final set of requirements from the second version as a starting point. Key product differentiators included changes to operate with a new Intel processor, the introduction of new hardware platforms and the addition of approximately fifty new features. Software development methodologies were nearly identical, with only the change to a continuous build process for source code check-in added. Despite the enhanced functionality and complexity in the third generation software, requirements defects, software defects, software sightings, feature commit vs. delivery (feature variance), defect closure efficiency rates, and number of days from project commit to customer release all improved from the second to the third generation of the software."

Code coverage measures can be useful as indicators of the thoroughness of unit test suites, while mutation testing turned out to be effective at finding faults. Objective This paper presents an experiment in which Test-First vs. Test-Last programming practices are examined with regard to branch coverage and mutation score indicator of unit tests. Method Student subjects were randomly assigned to Test-First and Test-Last groups. In order to further reduce pre-existing differences among subjects, and to get a more sensitive measure of our experimental effect, multivariate analysis of covariance was performed. Results Multivariate tests results indicate that there is no statistically significant difference between Test-First and Test-Last practices on the combined dependent variables, i.e. branch coverage and mutation score indicator, ( F ( 2 , 9 ) = . 52 , p &gt; . 05 ), even if we control for the pre-test results, the subjectsâ€™ experience, and when the subjects who showed deviations from the assigned programming technique are excluded from the analysis. Conclusion According to the preliminary results presented in this paper, the benefits of the Test-First practice in this specific context can be considered minor. Limitation It is probably the first-ever experimental evaluation of the impact of Test-First programming on mutation score indicator of unit tests and further experimentation is needed to establish evidence."
2482.0,Excluded,ec3,The impact of the Abilene Paradox on double-loop learning in an agile team,"This paper presents a qualitative investigation of learning failures associated with the introduction of a new software development methodology by a project team. This paper illustrates that learning is more than the cognitive process of acquiring a new skill; learning also involves changes in behaviour and even beliefs. Extreme Programming (XP), like other software development methodologies, provides a set of values and guidelines as to how software should be developed. As these new values and guidelines involve behavioural changes, the study investigates the introduction of \{XP\} as a new learning experience. Researchers use the concepts of single and double-loop learning to illustrate how social actors learn to perform tasks effectively and to determine the best task to perform. The concept of triple-loop learning explains how this learning process can be ineffective, accordingly it is employed to examine why the introduction of \{XP\} was ineffective in the team studied. While \{XP\} should ideally foster double-loop learning, triple-loop learning can explain why this does not necessarily occur. Research illustrates how power factors influence learning among groups of individuals; this study focuses on one specific power factor â€“ the power inherent in the desire to conform. The Abilene Paradox describes how groups can make ineffective decisions that are contrary to that which group members personally desire or believe. Ineffective decision-making occurs due to the desire to conform among group members; this was shown as the cause of ineffective learning in the software team studied. This desire to conform originated in how the project team cohered as a group, which was, in turn, influenced by the social values embraced by XP."

However, stakeholders do not always consider this matter and tend to stand to technical requirements of the method. Hence this paper aims at identifying aspects of organizational culture that may influence favorably or unfavorably the use of XP. In order to identify those aspects, this study analyzes dimensions of organizational culture under the perspective of practices and values of XP. This paper is based on the review of the literature of the area and empirical observations carried out with six software companies. This study does not intend to develop a tool for measurement of XPâ€™s compatibility with the organizational culture of each company.

2490.0,Excluded,ec3,The lean gap: A review of lean approaches to large-scale software systems development,"Abstract Lean approaches to product development (LPD) have had a strong influence on many industries and in recent years there have been many proponents for lean in software development as it can support the increasing industry need of scaling agile software development. With it's roots in industrial manufacturing and, later, industrial product development, it would seem natural that \{LPD\} would adapt well to large-scale development projects of increasingly software-intensive products, such as in the automotive industry. However, it is not clear what kind of experience and results have been reported on the actual use of lean principles and practices in software development for such large-scale industrial contexts. This was the motivation for this study as the context was an ongoing industry process improvement project at Volvo Car Corporation and Volvo Truck Corporation. The objectives of this study are to identify and classify state of the art in large-scale software development influenced by \{LPD\} approaches and use this established knowledge to support industrial partners in decisions on a software process improvement (SPI) project, and to reveal research gaps and proposed extensions to \{LPD\} in relation to its well-known principles and practices. For locating relevant state of the art we conducted a systematic mapping study, and the industrial applicability and relevance of results and said extensions to \{LPD\} were further analyzed in the context of an actual, industrial case. A total of 10,230 papers were found in database searches, of which 38 papers were found relevant. Of these, only 42 percent clearly addressed large-scale development. Furthermore, a majority of papers (76 percent) were non-empirical and many lacked information about study design, context and/or limitations. Most of the identified results focused on eliminating waste and creating flow in the software development process, but there was a lack of results for other \{LPD\} principles and practices. Overall, it can be concluded that research in the much hyped field of lean software development is in its nascent state when it comes to large scale development. There is very little support available for practitioners who want to apply lean approaches for improving large-scale software development, especially when it comes to inter-departmental interactions during development. This paper explicitly maps the area, qualifies available research, and identifies gaps, as well as suggests extensions to lean principles relevant for large scale development of software intensive systems."

The report also lays out the rationale for the agile approach to fixed-price contracts, and cites examples of successful implementations. The main challenges to successful delivery of agile projects under fixed-price contracts are as follows: Correct estimation of fixed-price agile projects; Misalignment between classical functional requirements and User Stories; Difficulty in handling change requests typical for agile projects with fixed budget; Differences between document-oriented and communication-oriented practices; Complexity of embedding specific agile projects into traditional (waterfall) customer environments; Tracking implemented scope and spent budget.

2494.0,Included,included,"The Many Lives of an Agile Story: Design Processes, Design Products, and Understandings in a Large-Scale Agile Development Project","In Agile Software Development (ASD), stakeholders use stories to stimulate conversations that create and convey understanding of software requirements. Some authors have argued that ASD methods have limited applicability to large-scale projects because agile stories are not sufficient to capture the complexities of up-front design. This paper reports a 2.5-year field study of how an ASD team for a complex software system adapted the user story concept and the Scrum approach. The team sought to create a convention for representing agile stories which could capture the complexities of the system requirements without burdening the team with unneeded documentation. They developed eight different ways to represent a story. The core representation of the approach was called a HyperEpic, a structured collection of closely-related HyperStories. HyperEpics required 90-99% fewer words than conventional specifications. Because of their dense form, Hyper-epics were not useful for other phases in the design/build processes. The team evolved a design/build work practice that proceeded in stages. In each stage, stories underwent a one or more transformations. Each transformation represented stories differently to create varied kinds of understandings among different stakeholder sets. The team was able to gain the benefits of ASD - faster development cycles, less documentation, rapid adaptation to insights and conditions."
2496.0,Excluded,ec3,The maturity of maturity model research: A systematic mapping study,"Context Maturity models offer organizations a simple but effective possibility to measure the quality of their processes. Emerged out of software engineering, the application fields have widened and maturity model research is becoming more important. During the last two decades the publication amount steadily rose as well. Until today, no studies have been available summarizing the activities and results of the field of maturity model research. Objective The objective of this paper is to structure and analyze the available literature of the field of maturity model research to identify the state-of-the-art research as well as research gaps. Method A systematic mapping study was conducted. It included relevant publications of journals and \{IS\} conferences. Mapping studies are a suitable method for structuring a broad research field concerning research questions about contents, methods, and trends in the available publications. Results The mapping of 237 articles showed that current maturity model research is applicable to more than 20 domains, heavily dominated by software development and software engineering. The study revealed that most publications deal with the development of maturity models and empirical studies. Theoretical reflective publications are scarce. Furthermore, the relation between conceptual and design-oriented maturity model development was analyzed, indicating that there is still a gap in evaluating and validating developed maturity models. Finally, a comprehensive research framework was derived from the study results and implications for further research are given. Conclusion The mapping study delivers the first systematic summary of maturity model research. The categorization of available publications helps researchers gain an overview of the state-of-the-art research and current research gaps. The proposed research framework supports researchers categorizing their own projects. In addition, practitioners planning to use a maturity model may use the study as starting point to identify which maturity models are suitable for their domain and where limitations exist."
2497.0,Excluded,ec3,The MultiRISK platform: The technical concept and application of a regional-scale multihazard exposure analysis tool,"Many regions worldwide are threatened by multiple natural hazards with the potential to cause high damages and losses. However, the modeling of multiple hazards in a joint analysis scheme is still in the early stages of development as a range of serious challenges emerges in the multihazard context such as differing modeling approaches in use for contrasting hazards; the time- and data-demanding conduct of each single preparative, intermediate and analysis step; and the clear visualization of the modeling outcome. Under consideration of these difficulties, a regional multihazard exposure analysis concept is developed for five natural hazards: debris flows, rock falls, shallow landslides, avalanches, and river floods, complemented by a visualization scheme to present the modeling outcome. An automation of the two schemes resulted in a beta version of the MultiRISK modeling and the MultiRISK visualization software tool forming together the MultiRISK platform. To test the analysis scheme and the software implementation of MultiRISK a case study is performed in the Barcelonnette basin in France with a worst-case parameterization of the models on the basis of extensive literature reviews. Experiences from this case study offered many insights into the multihazard topic and even more questions, e.g. with respect to coherent multihazard model parameterization, validation or the comparability and interpretation of single-hazard modeling results, respectively. Although analysis schemes can be proposed and software tools can be provided to facilitate many steps, a well-conceived and reflective approach to multihazard settings is essential. The worst-case analysis based on literature values apparently leads to an overestimation of the susceptible areas and the number of exposed elements. Nevertheless, depending on the data situation of an area, especially in areas without any information on past events, this approach may offer the determination of general hazard distributions, overlaps, and areas of potential risk without data-demanding calibration."

However, rich processes are hard to implement. They often contain hundreds of pages of documentation. Development teams tend to be skeptical about rich processes in fear of additional effort, risking the benefits of rich tool support for enactment. Process enactment is a challenging task. There is no common methodology to quickly â€œimplementâ€� a development process in a tool or a set of tools. Often specialized tools are used to provide assistance during the project and it is the project managerâ€™s task to consolidate the information with the rest of the team. The Process Enactment Tool Framework (PET) is a software tool that supports the transformation of a given formal development process into a format that project tools can work with. \{PET\} is an instrument to import processes based on a metamodel and provide exports for a specific project environment. \{PET\} takes an input software development process model and transforms it into an intermediate format that serves as the basis for a second transformation step into data formats of tools such as office suites or comprehensive \{ALM\} platforms. In this paper we present the tool framework and show how metamodel-based processes can be transformed into an environment that is ready to use for a project team. We show how \{PET\} is applied for the German V-ModellÂ XT and for SPEM-based processes to generate, e.g., process templates for the Team Foundation Server or work product document templates."

2509.0,Excluded,ec7,The Regulatory World and the Machine: Harmonizing Legal Requirements and the Systems They Affect," The past decade has seen a substantial increase in the issuance of privacy and security regulations governing personal information. Ensuring system and organizational compliance is both more important and more difficult than ever before, as the penalties have become more severe, and regulations more complex and nuanced. This also presents substantial difficulties for multi-national companies, as different states, countries, or regions do not adhere to a uniform standard, resulting in a mixed set of regulations for the systems they govern. In this work, I describe a framework to address this issue, referred to as requirements water marking, wherein requirements from different jurisdictions that govern the same system may be evaluated and reduced to a single standard of care, establishing a “high water mark” for regulatory compliance and reducing requirements complexity. The framework, which draws on work in requirements specification languages and requirements comparison, allows engineers and legal experts to systematically simplify compliance and determine both high and low standards of care, while maintaining traceability back to the original legal text. In addition, I investigate the proposed value of legal requirements models, demonstrating the relationship between proposed value of these models to organizational decision-making and the validity of the model."

Based on the Competing Values Model of organizational culture, the paper proposes a number of hypotheses about the relationship between organizational culture and the deployment of agile methods. Results Inspired by the agile methods thirteen new hypotheses are introduced and discussed. They have interesting implications, when contrasted with ad hoc development and with traditional systems development methods. Conclusion Because of the conceptual richness of organizational culture and the ambiguity of the concept of agility the relationship between organizational culture and the deployment of agile systems development forms a rich and interesting research topic. Recognizing that the Competing Values Model represents just one view of organizational culture, the paper introduces a number of alternative conceptions and identifies several interesting paths for future research into the relationship between organizational culture and agile methods deployment."

For software development companies, this problem has become an increasing dilemma, as typically plan-driven software development assessment standards like the capability maturity model (CMM) or ISO/IEC 15504 have not always been easy to conform processes against. Particularly, in environments where requirements are rapidly changing, more agile approaches such as Scrum and extreme programming (XP) have caught on. In this work, we are reporting from a case study of an organization looking to not move completely from their plan-based processes (as they are but a part of a larger organization operating in a plan-based way), but rather adapt their overarching processes in a way that allows them to use XP to support their everyday work precluded by their current processes. To this end, we present four perspectives that organizations may take when they desire or consider becoming more agile in their development. We use the Nerur et al. (2005) key issues for moving from plan-based to agile software development to compare and analyze our findings. In doing this, we highlight a set of likely criteria necessary to successfully create a combination of the plan-driven and agile approaches.

2520.0,Excluded,ec6,The role of modelling in the software engineering curriculum,"This paper argues that the concept of modelling, and particularly the modelling of software system structures, is not being given sufficient attention within current sources that describe aspects of the software engineering curriculum. The paper describes the scope of modelling as a general concept, and explains the role that the modelling of software system structures plays within it. It discusses the treatment of this role within the various sources, and compares this both with the experience of the role that such modelling plays in the undergraduate curriculum at Sheffield University, and with the practice in other branches of engineering. The idea is examined that modelling should be treated as a recurring concept within the curriculum, and it is shown that this gives rise to a matrix structure for the software engineering curriculum. The paper discusses how such a structure can be mapped into a conventional hierarchical curriculum model, and the relationships that need to be made explicit in doing so. It describes the practical implications of these results for the structures of degree programmes in software engineering."

2522.0,Included,included,The role of physical artefacts in agile software development: Two complementary perspectives,"Agile software development promotes feedback, discipline and close collaboration between all members of the development team, and de-emphasises documentation, â€˜big design up frontâ€™ and hierarchical processes. Agile teams tend to be co-located and multi-disciplinary, and rely heavily on face-to-face communication and seemingly simple physical artefacts to support interaction. In this paper we focus on the functionality of two key physical artefacts â€“ the story card and the Wall â€“ which, individually and in combination, underpin the teamâ€™s activity. These artefacts have two main roles â€“ one which enables a shared understanding of requirements and one which facilitates the development process itself. We consider these roles from two perspectives: a notational perspective and a social perspective. This discussion shows how the two perspectives â€“ the notational and the social â€“ intertwine and are mutually supportive. Any attempt to replace these physical artefacts with alternative support for an agile team needs to take account of both perspectives, and the complex relationships between them."
2523.0,Excluded,ec3,The role of social interaction in software effort estimation: Unpacking the â€œmagic stepâ€� between reasoning and decision-making,"Context Software effort estimation is a core task regarding planning, budgeting and controlling software development projects. However, providing accurate effort estimates is challenging. Estimation work is increasingly group based, and to support it, there is a need to reveal how work practices are carried out as collaborative efforts. Objective This paper examines the use of concepts in software effort estimation by analysing group work as communicative practice. The objective is to improve our understanding of how software professionals invoke different types of knowledge when talking, reasoning and reaching a decision on a software effort estimate. Method Estimation meetings in the industry where planning poker was used as the estimation method have been video recorded and analysed by means of the interaction analysis technique, focusing on the communicative and collaborative aspects of the group work. Results The user story mediates the types of resources and knowledge needed to solve the task. Concepts from the knowledge domain are used to frame the task and allow the participants to reach consensus, sufficient to take the next step in the problem-solving activity. Individual knowledge seems to be the dominating orientation when it comes to specifying the work needed for solving the tasks. Conclusion The step from reasoning to decision-making has been called the â€œmagic stepâ€� in software effort estimation. We argue that the magic step is found in the analysis of the social interaction in which the concepts used are anchored in the knowledge domain of software engineering and in the historical experiences of the participants and subsequently become activated. We propose that by taking a socio-cultural perspective on concepts in activities, the ways in which software professionals reach a decision can be unpacked. The paper contributes to an understanding of the role of concepts in group work and of software effort estimation as a specific work practice."

The vagaries of the environment and multiple stakeholders create uncertainty in the requirements for an information system product that impedes development of a high quality product along common dimensions of efficiency, flexibility and responsiveness. The ability of a team to solve problems that arise before and during the course of the project can help overcome uncertainty of requirements. A project can be designed with both reactive and anticipatory mechanisms that heighten problem solving competency and improve product quality of the resulting information system. We develop a model based on work in new product development and test it with a sample of 119 information system (IS) development professionals to examine the expected relationship.

While no industry is immune from project failure, the Information Technology (IT) industry is shown to be more susceptible to risk and failure than those of other industries. Agile project management, which facilitates adaptation to changing circumstances and alleviates rigid formal controls, has become more popular in the software development industry though is not entirely compatible with traditional project management approaches. In this paper we will examine the primary causes of \{IT\} project management failure stated in modern literature, analyze these causes, and discuss the degree of complexity within the projects from a systemic perspective related to emergence, non- monotonicity, and non-ergodicity. The paper concludes with some conceptual management approaches that respond to these â€œtrueâ€� root causes of failure, for applications in agile organizations and beyond."

2535.0,Excluded,ec3,The situational factors that affect the software development process: Towards a comprehensive reference framework,"Context An optimal software development process is regarded as being dependent on the situational characteristics of individual software development settings. Such characteristics include the nature of the application(s) under development, team size, requirements volatility and personnel experience. However, no comprehensive reference framework of the situational factors affecting the software development process is presently available. Objective The absence of such a comprehensive reference framework of the situational factors affecting the software development process is problematic not just because it inhibits our ability to optimise the software development process, but perhaps more importantly, because it potentially undermines our capacity to ascertain the key constraints and characteristics of a software development setting. Method To address this deficiency, we have consolidated a substantial body of related research into an initial reference framework of the situational factors affecting the software development process. To support the data consolidation, we have applied rigorous data coding techniques from Grounded Theory and we believe that the resulting framework represents an important contribution to the software engineering field of knowledge. Results The resulting reference framework of situational factors consists of eight classifications and 44 factors that inform the software process. We believe that the situational factor reference framework presented herein represents a sound initial reference framework for the key situational elements affecting the software process definition. Conclusion In addition to providing a useful reference listing for the research community and for committees engaged in the development of standards, the reference framework also provides support for practitioners who are challenged with defining and maintaining software development processes. Furthermore, this framework can be used to develop a profile of the situational characteristics of a software development setting, which in turn provides a sound foundation for software development process definition and optimisation."

Productions and modifications as operations on artifacts and milestones are abstracted as editing operations. The process can equip the abstract document with the abstract role, and equip the role with personnel and man-hour, and then record actual man-hour for tracking and controlling the cost and quality. Personnel associated with the abstract document can easily find own tasks after logging in. Such abstract processes, making the entire software development process to manage the abstract document as the core, we can greatly simplify the entire software development process. The costs and quality is tracked and controlled, it is easy to find and locate defects as a basis of the plan, thus to adjust and improve the overall software development process in real time, and continuously improve the standards and standardization level of software technology."

It can be thought of as revolving around the interplay of three basic forces: (a) a dynamic environment, filled with opportunities and threats, (b) an innovative and agile organizational system, and (c) strategic leadership whose role is to mediate between these two forces, to optimize existing processes and systems and, at the same time, to discover new opportunities and to capitalize on them. The purpose of this paper is to evidence the technology dimension of strategic leadership and to analyze new perspectives for production economics. We describe first the rules of the game in a dynamic and hypercompetitive environment. By examining the differences between leadership and management, it is possible, first to identify and understand the different roles of production economists and second to analyze the two most critical tasks of production economists: (a) as a manager, to optimize existing processes and systems, and (b) as a leader, to invent the future and to inspire people to work enthusiastically for achieving challenging goals. The message of the paper is that a comprehensive conceptual framework for integrating technology into strategic leadership increases the probability that a firm can achieve superior long-term performance."
2541.0,Excluded,ec3,The Timeboxing Process Model for Iterative Software Development,"In today's business where speed is of essence, an iterative development approach that allows the functionality to be delivered in parts has become a necessity and an effective way to manage risks. In an iterative process, the development of a software system is done in increments, each increment forming of an iteration and resulting in a working system. AÂ common iterative approach is to decide what should be developed in an iteration and then plan the iteration accordingly. AÂ somewhat different iterative approach is to time box different iterations. In this approach, the length of an iteration is fixed and what should be developed in an iteration is adjusted to fit the time box. Generally, the time boxed iterations are executed in sequence, with some overlap where feasible. In this paper we propose the timeboxing process model that takes the concept of time boxed iterations further by adding pipelining concepts to it for permitting overlapped execution of different iterations. In the timeboxing process model, each time boxed iteration is divided into equal length stages, each stage having a defined function and resulting in a clear work product that is handed over to the next stage. With this division into stages, pipelining concepts are employed to have multiple time boxes executing concurrently, leading to a reduction in the delivery time for product releases. We illustrate the use of this process model through an example of a commercial project that was successfully executed using the proposed model."

2551.0,Excluded,ec3,The value of software sizing,"Context One of the difficulties faced by software development Project Managers is estimating the cost and schedule for new projects. Previous industry surveys have concluded that software size and cost estimation is a significant technical area of concern. In order to estimate cost and schedule it is important to have a good understanding of the size of the software product to be developed. There are a number of techniques used to derive software size, with function points being amongst the most documented. Objective In this paper we explore the utility of function point software sizing techniques when applied to two levels of software requirements documentation in a commercial software development organisation. The goal of the research is to appraise the value (cost/benefit) which functional sizing techniques can bring to the project planning and management of software projects within a small-to-medium sized software development enterprise (SME). Method Functional counts were made at the bid and detailed functional specification stages for each of five commercial projects used in the research. Three variants of the \{NESMA\} method were used to determine these function counts. Through a structured interview session, feedback on the sizing results was obtained to evaluate its feasibility and potential future contribution to the company. Results The results of our research suggest there is value in performing size estimates at two appropriate stages in the software development lifecycle, with simplified methods providing the optimal return on effort expended. Conclusion The â€˜Estimated NESMAâ€™ is the most appropriate tool for use in size estimation for the company studied. The use of software sizing provides a valuable contribution which would augment, but not replace, the companyâ€™s existing cost estimation approach."

The software development community has solved a similar problem (not having enough resources to implement everything that was asked for) by introducing agile development methods, which offer ways of segmenting the overall project, and choosing which parts to allocate resources to. This paper is about how insights from that agile development community can be applied to requirements engineering activities for any (agile or non-agile) development project. Key terms in agile development, such as “working product” and “user story”, must be mapped intelligently to terms in requirements engineering - and not simply copied: the “product” of requirements engineering is not the same as the “product” being implemented by developers."

Method A multiple case study was conducted, in which the problems faced by six developers working on four different Java systems were registered on a daily basis, for a period up to four weeks. Where applicable, the files associated to the problems were registered. Code smells were detected in the pre-maintenance version of the systems, using the tools Borland Together and InCode. In-depth examination of quantitative and qualitative data was conducted to determine if the observed problems could be explained by the detected smells. Results From the total set of problems, roughly 30% percent were related to files containing code smells. In addition, interaction effects were observed amongst code smells, and between code smells and other code characteristics, and these effects led to severe problems during maintenance. Code smell interactions were observed between collocated smells (i.e., in the same file), and between coupled smells (i.e., spread over multiple files that were coupled). Conclusions The role of code smells on the overall system maintainability is relatively minor, thus complementary approaches are needed to achieve more comprehensive assessments of maintainability. Moreover, to improve the explanatory power of code smells, interaction effects amongst collocated smells and coupled smells should be taken into account during analysis."

Putting these ideas into practice in the quickly evolving discipline of software engineering has proven elusive. Techniques and tools are needed that help software practitioners apply past knowledge to current projects while engaging in knowledge creation processes. This paper outlines the experience factory and organizational learning approaches, both of which explore how experience-based approaches to software development can be used to improve software development practices. AÂ software tool is used to investigate how these two approaches can be integrated to create an approach that addresses many issues of knowledge management in the software engineering field."

2582.0,Excluded,ec3,Tools used in Global Software Engineering: A systematic mapping review,"Context This systematic mapping review is set in a Global Software Engineering (GSE) context, characterized by a highly distributed environment in which project team members work separately in different countries. This geographic separation creates specific challenges associated with global communication, coordination and control. Objective The main goal of this study is to discover all the available communication and coordination tools that can support highly distributed teams, how these tools have been applied in GSE, and then to describe and classify the tools to allow both practitioners and researchers involved in \{GSE\} to make use of the available tool support in GSE. Method We performed a systematic mapping review through a search for studies that answered our research question, â€œWhich software tools (commercial, free or research based) are available to support Global Software Engineering?â€� Applying a range of related search terms to key electronic databases, selected journals, and conferences and workshops enabled us to extract relevant papers. We then used a data extraction template to classify, extract and record important information about the \{GSD\} tools from each paper. This information was synthesized and presented as a general map of types of \{GSD\} tools, the toolâ€™s main features and how each tool was validated in practice. Results The main result is a list of 132 tools, which, according to the literature, have been, or are intended to be, used in global software projects. The classification of these tools includes lists of features for communication, coordination and control as well as how the tool has been validated in practice. We found that out the total of 132, the majority of tools were developed at research centers, and only a small percentage of tools (18.9%) are reported as having been tested outside the initial context in which they were developed. Conclusion The most common features in the \{GSE\} tools included in this study are: team activity and social awareness, support for informal communication, Support for Distributed Knowledge Management and Interoperability with other tools. Finally, there is the need for an evaluation of these tools to verify their external validity, or usefulness in a wider global environment."
2583.0,Included,included,Tool-supported process analysis and design for the development of multi-agent systems,"This paper introduces a methodology for the development of multi-agent systems, in particular multi-agent systems that optimize the collaboration of distributed work groups like clinical departments. A major difficulty with such systems is requirements elicitation, because intimate knowledge of the work processes is needed to identify the potential agent application scenarios. In the face of uncertain requirements, our methodology exploits some ideas from agile software development approaches such as Extreme Programming, namely the values of collaboration with domain experts and of human creativity driven by rapid feedback. We support collaboration by means of a tool-supported modeling approach that allows one to capture existing and agentified processes in a format that is sufficiently simple to be understood and maintained by domain experts. These process models can be automatically synchronized with executable agent source code, so that rapid feedback is ensured. We support creativity by means of a searchable repository of reusable agent design patterns and other types of process modeling knowledge. Â© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003."

Several prioritization methods and supporting tools have been proposed so far. How to evaluate their properties, with the aim of supporting the selection of the most appropriate method for a specific project, is considered a relevant question. In this paper, we present an empirical study aiming at evaluating two state-of-the art tool-supported requirements prioritization methods, \{AHP\} and CBRank. We focus on three measures: the ease of use, the time-consumption and the accuracy. The experiment has been conducted with 23 experienced subjects on a set of 20 requirements from a real project. Results indicate that for the first two characteristics \{CBRank\} overcomes AHP, while for the accuracy \{AHP\} performs better than CBRank, even if the resulting ranks from the two methods are very similar. The majority of the users found \{CBRank\} the â€œoverall bestâ€� method."

Satisfaction assessment is useful because it assists in discovering unsatisfied requirements early in the lifecycle when such issues can be corrected with lower cost and impact than later. We define the basic terms and concepts for this process and explore the feasibility of developing baseline methods for its automation. This paper describes the satisfaction assessment approach algorithmically and then evaluates the effectiveness of two proposed information retrieval (IR) methods in two industrial studies - one based on a large dataset including a complete requirements specification and design specification for a NASA science instrument, and one based on a smaller dataset for an open source project management dataset. We found that both approaches have merit, and that the more sophisticated approach outperformed the simpler approach in terms of overall accuracy of the results."
2590.0,Excluded,ec3,Toward data mining engineering: A software engineering approach,"The number, variety and complexity of projects involving data mining or knowledge discovery in databases activities have increased just lately at such a pace that aspects related to their development process need to be standardized for results to be integrated, reused and interchanged in the future. Data mining projects are quickly becoming engineering projects, and current standard processes, like CRISP-DM, need to be revisited to incorporate this engineering viewpoint. This is the central motivation of this paper that makes the point that experience gained about the software development process over almost 40 years could be reused and integrated to improve data mining processes.

2592.0,Excluded,ec3,Toward mobile entertainment: A paradigm for narrative-based audio only games,"The widespread use of sophisticated mobile computing devices has set the stage for a renaissance in audio only entertainment. Traditional visual games are already used widely in cellular phones and similar devices. A significant limitation is the small display size. In contrast, audio only games on suitable mobile hardware need not degrade due to the smaller form factor. This makes audio only games an attractive alternative to visual games. We describe a framework for authoring interactive narrative-based audio only games set in 3D virtual environments. Despite the novelty in audio only gaming, our approach builds on a foundation of several years of research into audio only applications for sight impaired users, augmented reality systems and humanâ€“computer interaction studies. In comparison to attempts to provide a realistic user interface, we argue a simple interface enhances both immersion and entertainment value, serendipitously making audio only games practical for mobile computing. Novel features of our system include real-time gameplay and multi-player support. We also describe our software architecture, the current implementation of which uses low-cost existing PC-based hardware and software. In addition, we describe our first game, Dragonâ€™s Roar."

Methods: We have used a holistic health information system as a core application framework. System functionality is incrementally improved using an integrated â€œgenerator toolâ€� for rapid application development. We have developed an iterative and participatory software engineering process, adapted to the conditions of the generator tool. The documentation techniques provided by the Unified Modeling Language (UML) were modified to achieve a straight forward documentation covering the whole development cycle from the business process model to generator-based computer applications. Results and conclusion: The layered approach for system evolution did provide an environment in which a flexible and participatory software development process could be established. Today, generator-based applications are used in all clinical departments of our 1200-bed University Hospital. We expect that tools for rapid application development will be further improved and will play an increasingly important role to establish responsive IT-infrastructures where the application developer can concentrate on business process alignment instead of coding and debugging."

The company aims at improving their current RBTG practice by enhancing the reuse of test artifacts across different products. Due to the complexity of developing such systems and being in the context of system product-line engineering, achieving this goal requires a systematic approach for RBTG. As the first step to this end, we conducted a domain analysis with the industry partner to characterize their current practice of applying RBTG and to identify their needs and challenges.

2616.0,Included,included,Towards approximating COSMIC functional size from user requirements in agile development processes using text mining,"Measurement of software size from user requirements is crucial for the estimation of the developmental time and effort. COSMIC, an ISO/IEC international standard for functional size measurement, provides an objective method of measuring the functional size of the software from user requirements. COSMIC requires the user requirements to be written at a level of granularity, where interactions between the internal and the external environments to the system are visible to the human measurer, in a form similar to use case descriptions. On the other hand, requirements during an agile software development iteration are written in a less formal way than use case descriptions - often in the form of user stories, for example, keeping with the goal of delivering a planned release as quickly as possible. Therefore, size measurement in agile processes uses methods (e.g. story-points, smart estimation) that strictly depend on the subjective judgment of the experts, and avoid using objective measurement methods like COSMIC. In this paper, we presented an innovative concept showing that using a supervised text mining approach, COSMIC functional size can be automatically approximated from informally written textual requirements, demonstrating its applicability in popular agile software development processes, such as Scrum.

Then, the questionnaire was applied on a semi-random sample of 176 software engineers from 20 software companies located in Recife-PE, Brazil. Results The survey results show the actual level of motivation for each motivator in the target population. Using principal component analysis on the values of all motivators, a five factor structure was identified and used to propose a guideline for the creation of motivational programs for software engineers.

2647.0,Excluded,ec7,Translating standards into practice: Experience and lessons learned at the Department of Veterans Affairs,"The increased need for interoperable electronic health records in health care organizations underscores the importance of standards. The \{US\} Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a long history of developing and adopting various types of health care data standards. The authors present in detail their experience in this domain. A formal organization within \{VA\} is responsible for helping to develop and implement standards. This group has produced a Standards Life Cycle (SLC) process endorsed by \{VA\} key business and information technology (IT) stakeholders. It coordinates the identification, description, and implementation of standards aligned with \{VA\} business requirements. In this paper, we review the adoption of four standards in the categories of security and privacy, terminology, health information exchange, and modeling tools; emphasizing the implementation approach used in each. In our experience, adoption is facilitated by internal staff with expertise in standards development and adoption. Use of processes such as an \{SLC\} and tools such as an enterprise requirement repository help formally track and ensure that \{IT\} development and acquisition incorporate these standards. An organization should adopt standards that are aligned with its business priorities and favor those that are more readily implementable. To assist with this final point, we offer a standard â€œLikelihood of Adoption Scale,â€� which changes as standards specifications evolve from \{PDF\} documents only, to \{PDF\} documents with construction and testing tools, to fully functional reference implementations."

Unpredictable workloads, however, aggravate the semantic gap between the virtual machine monitor and guest operating systems, leading to inefficient resource management. In particular, \{CPU\} management for virtual machines has a critical impact on I/O performance in cases where the virtual machine monitor is agnostic about the internal workloads of each virtual machine. This paper presents virtual machine scheduling techniques for transparently bridging the semantic gap that is a result of consolidated workloads. To enable us to achieve this goal, we ensure that the virtual machine monitor is aware of task-level I/O-boundedness inside a virtual machine using inference techniques, thereby improving I/O performance without compromising \{CPU\} fairness. In addition, we address performance anomalies arising from the indirect use of I/O devices via a driver virtual machine at the scheduling level. The proposed techniques are implemented on the Xen virtual machine monitor and evaluated with micro-benchmarks and real workloads on Linux and Windows guest operating systems."
2649.0,Excluded,ec3,Tunable ferroelectric impedance matching networks and their impact on digital modulation system performance,"Abstract In this paper the bit error rate performance and error vector magnitude of a tunable impedance matching network is analyzed assuming QPSK, 16-QAM and 64-QAM digital modulation schemes. The characterized tunable impedance matching network is based on bariumâ€“strontiumâ€“titanate ferroelectric thick-film varactors. Inherent dispersive behavior is subsumed into the forward transmission of the passive device. Due to this nonlinear phase response, in general to maximize the overall system performance, an agile tuning of the varactor values is demonstrated, taking into account the phase and group delay of s21 parameter. Detailed signal simulation results based on measured data of a testbed are presented. The influence of varying matched impedances on the tuning behavior with different modulation bandwidths is discussed at a center frequency of 1.9&#xa0;GHz."
2650.0,Excluded,ec3,Two controlled experiments concerning the comparison of pair programming to peer review,"This paper reports on two controlled experiments comparing pair programming with single developers who are assisted by an additional anonymous peer code review phase. The experiments were conducted in the summer semester 2002 and 2003 at the University of Karlsruhe with 38 computer science students. Instead of comparing pair programming to solo programming this study aims at finding a technique by which a single developer produces similar program quality as programmer pairs do but with moderate cost. The study has one major finding concerning the cost of the two development methods. Single developers are as costly as programmer pairs, if both programmer pairs and single developers with an additional review phase are forced to produce programs of similar level of correctness. In conclusion, programmer pairs and single developers become interchangeable in terms of development cost. As this paper reports on the results of small development tasks the comparison could not take into account long time benefits of either technique."

2660.0,Excluded,ec7,UML-based hardware/software co-design platform for dynamically partially reconfigurable network security systems,"The dynamic partial reconfiguration technology of \{FPGA\} has made it possible to adapt system functionalities at run-time to changing environment conditions. However, this new dimension of dynamic hardware reconfigurability has rendered existing \{CAD\} tools and platforms incapable of efficiently exploring the design space. As a solution, we proposed a novel UML-based hardware/software co-design platform (UCoP) targeting at dynamically partially reconfigurable network security systems (DPRNSS). Computation-intensive network security functions, implemented as reconfigurable hardware functions, can be configured on-demand into a \{DPRNSS\} at run-time. Thus, \{UCoP\} not only supports dynamic adaptation to different environment conditions, but also increases hardware resource utilization. \{UCoP\} supports design space exploration for reconfigurable systems in three folds. Firstly, it provides reusable models of typical reconfigurable systems that can be customized according to user applications. Secondly, \{UCoP\} provides a partially reconfigurable hardware task template, using which users can focus on their hardware designs without going through the full partial reconfiguration flow. Thirdly, \{UCoP\} provides direct interactions between \{UML\} system models and real reconfigurable hardware modules, thus allowing accurate time measurements. Compared to the existing lower-bound and synthesis-based estimation methods, the accurate time measurements using \{UCoP\} at a high abstraction level can more efficiently reduce the system development efforts."

By integrating theories from systems development methodologies, diffusion of innovations, and agile methodology literature, this paper proposes a new model that identifies a set of critical factors pertinent to post-adoptive usage of agile practices. This model is used to inform analysis of post-adoptive usage of agile practices in two major organizations. The results indicate relative advantage, team attitude and technical competence, championing, and top management support (TMS) are the key factors determining the extent to which agile practices can be assimilated into an organization. Specifically, both findings and this model confirm that the deeper the assimilation of agile practices into the organization, the better understanding of how assimilation leads to specific improvements in its systems development outcomes."
2668.0,Excluded,ec3,Understanding the characteristics of quality for software engineering processes: A Grounded Theory investigation,"AbstractContext Software engineering organizations routinely define and implement processes to support, guide and control project execution. An assumption underlying this process-centric approach to business improvement is that the quality of the process will influence the quality, cost and time-to-release of the software produced. A critical question thus arises of what constitutes quality for software engineering processes. Objective To identify criteria used by experienced practitioners to judge the quality of software engineering processes and to understand how knowledge of these criteria and their relationships may be useful for those undertaking software process improvement activities. Method Interviews were conducted with 17 experienced software engineering practitioners from a range of geographies, roles and industry sectors. Published reports from 30 software process improvement case-studies were selected from multiple peer-reviewed software journals. A qualitative Grounded Theory-based methodology was employed to systematically analyze the collected data to synthesize a model of quality for software engineering processes. Results The synthesized model suggests that practitioners perceive the overall quality of a software engineering process based on four quality attributes: suitability, usability, manageability and evolvability. Furthermore, these judgments are influenced by key properties related to the semantic content, structure, representation and enactment of that process. The model indicates that these attributes correspond to particular organizational perspectives and that these differing views may explain role-based conflicts in the judgement of process quality. Conclusion Consensus exists amongst practitioners about which characteristics of software engineering process quality most influence project outcomes. The model presented provides a terminological framework that can facilitate precise discussion of software engineering process issues and a set of criteria that can support activities for software process definition, evaluation and improvement. The potential exists for further development of this model to facilitate optimization of process properties to match organizational needs."

First, product goals are set without an adequate study of the userpsilas needs and context. The user stories selected may not be good enough from the usability perspective. Second, user stories of usability import may not be prioritized high enough. Third, given the fact that a product owner thinks in terms of the minimal marketable set of features in a just-in-time process, it is difficult for the development team to get a holistic view of the desired product or features. This experience report proposes U-SCRUM as a variant of the SCRUM methodology.

This paper highlights issues in different stages of the User Needs Analysis that appear to cause considerable confusion among researchers and practitioners. It is our hope that the User-Centred Design community may begin to address these issues systematically. A case study is presented reporting a User Needs Analysis methodology and process as well as the user interface design of an application supporting communication among first responders in a major disaster. It illustrates some of the differences between the User-Centred Design and the Requirements Engineering communities and shows how and where User-Centred Design and Requirements Engineering methodologies should be integrated, or at least aligned, to avoid some of the problems practitioners face during the User Needs Analysis."

However, there are also hazards associated with the introduction of \{ICTs\} in this domain and a great number of projects have failed due to the lack of systematic consideration of human and other non-technology issues throughout the design or implementation process, particularly in the requirements engineering process. This paper presents the methodological approach followed in the design process of a web-based information system (WbIS) for managing the clinical information in hemophilia care, which integrates the values and practices of user-centered design (UCD) activities into the principles of software engineering, particularly in the phase of requirements engineering (RE). This process followed a paradigm that combines a grounded theory for data collection with an evolutionary design based on constant development and refinement of the generic domain model using three well-known methodological approaches: (a) object-oriented system analysis; (b) task analysis; and, (c) prototyping, in a triangulation work. This approach seems to be a good solution for the requirements engineering process in this particular case of the health care domain, since the inherent weaknesses of individual methods are reduced, and emergent requirements are easier to elicit. Moreover, the requirements triangulation matrix gives the opportunity to look across the results of all used methods and decide what requirements are critical for the system success."

The chapter discusses the concept of the two user interface architectures, based on the BM_Virtual Enterprise Architecture Reference Model (BM-VEARM), and their role in \{VE\} operations: the â€œdirectâ€� communication architecture (DCA) and the â€œvirtualâ€� communication architecture (VCA) as well as an implementation. The developed implementation is based on basic available technologies capable of representing the phenomena. The \{DCA\} implementation consists of face-to-face communication through the \{MSN\} Messenger. The end-user can hear and see an interlocutor on the computer screen. The \{VCA\} is based on a \{MS\} Agent technology interface. The end-user cannot see or hear the human interlocutor because he is â€œmaskedâ€� by one of the chosen software agents. In the application, called e-Mask, the end-user always sees the same software agent/mask and hears the same voice (mask's). It is expected that the set-up time, that is, the end-user adaptation time, will be similar with or without a change in the interlocutor during a conversation when using the VCA. A comparison of the two proposed architectures is presented."

Mobile users in ubiquitous networks expect to access information services anytime, and from anywhere. This paper presents a mobile content sharing scenario in which a networked device can discover neighboring devices and share multimedia content in a convenient, networked manner. This ideal scenario differs from the traditional usage which requires the tedious manual operations of connection setup and file transfer. To achieve this goal, this study proposes a user-provided multimedia content distribution architecture for a mobile and ubiquitous network environment. The proposed architecture integrates several specific mechanisms, including device discovery, asynchronous content delivery, secure access control, and virtual file system. This design addresses several inherent limitations in wireless and mobile networks, and enables mobile users to transfer media content in a secure, mobile, and energy-saving way. The proof-of-concept prototype and performance evaluation in this study confirm that the proposed architecture not only provides better user experience, but also achieves a lightweight design without compromising performance."

2708.0,Excluded,ec7,Using acceptance tests as a support for clarifying requirements: A series of experiments,"One of the main reasons for the failure of many software projects is the late discovery of a mismatch between the customersâ€™ expectations and the pieces of functionality implemented in the delivered system. At the root of such a mismatch is often a set of poorly defined, incomplete, under-specified, and inconsistent requirements. Test driven development has recently been proposed as a way to clarify requirements during the initial elicitation phase, by means of acceptance tests that specify the desired behavior of the system. The goal of the work reported in this paper is to empirically characterize the contribution of acceptance tests to the clarification of the requirements coming from the customer. We focused on Fit tables, a way to express acceptance tests, which can be automatically translated into executable test cases. We ran two experiments with students from University of Trento and Politecnico of Torino, to assess the impact of Fit tables on the clarity of requirements. We considered whether Fit tables actually improve requirement understanding and whether this requires any additional comprehension effort. Experimental results show that Fit helps in the understanding of requirements without requiring a significant additional effort."

Traditionally, variability has been treated proactively by investing in an upfront domain analysis phase. Such proactive treatment of requirements is not encouraged in agile environments. This paper provides an observational study examining a reactive approach to variability wherein acceptance tests are used to elicit variability from requirements in an incremental manner. The findings suggest the following: the approach does support the evolutionary nature of agile development, the approach is easy and quick to learn, using acceptance tests yields consistent variability interpretations, and acceptance tests - on their own - may be insufficient to reflect implicit variability constraints."

The ideal solution is to use a computational environment that allows industrial engineers to implement the system using high-level language and that follows international standards. Accordingly, this paper proposes a methodology to model and validate control programs for manufacturing systems that include sequential, parallel and timed operations, using a formalism based on Statecharts, denominated Basic Statechart (BSC). To improve the formal aspects of the original Statecharts, we introduce the semantic of the \{BSC\} using only characteristics relevant to the industrial area. We also present an algorithm that translates the control model described in \{BSC\} into Ladder diagrams, thereby enabling tests with actual PLCs. Finally, one typical example of application in the manufacturing area is discussed as case study to illustrate the proposed methodology."

Correlations between the extracted factors were calculated, and the significant correlation findings suggested that people who applied iterative and incremental development and quality assurance practices had a high success rate, that communication with the customer was not very popular as it had negative correlations with governance and iterative and incremental development. Also, people who applied governance practices also applied quality assurance practices.

2744.0,Excluded,ec3,Using planning poker for combining expert estimates in software projects,"When producing estimates in software projects, expert opinions are frequently combined. However, it is poorly understood whether, when, and how to combine expert estimates. In order to study the effects of a combination technique called planning poker, the technique was introduced in a software project for half of the tasks. The tasks estimated with planning poker provided: (1) group consensus estimates that were less optimistic than the statistical combination (mean) of individual estimates for the same tasks, and (2) group consensus estimates that were more accurate than the statistical combination of individual estimates for the same tasks. For tasks in the same project, individual experts who estimated a set of control tasks achieved estimation accuracy similar to that achieved by estimators who estimated tasks using planning poker. Moreover, for both planning poker and the control group, measures of the median estimation bias indicated that both groups had unbiased estimates, because the typical estimated task was perfectly on target. A code analysis revealed that for tasks estimated with planning poker, more effort was expended due to the complexity of the changes to be made, possibly caused by the information provided in group discussions."

Case study reports on the successful use of agile practices in small distributed projects already exist. How these practices can be applied to larger projects, however, remains unstudied. This paper reports a case study on agile practices in a 40-person development organization distributed between Norway and Malaysia. Based on seven interviews in the development organization, we describe how scrum practices were successfully applied, e.g. using teleconferencing and web cameras for daily scrum meetings, synchronized 4-week sprints, weekly scrum-of-scrums, and Jira for backlog management. Non-scrum agile practices included nightly builds, automated testing, and team rooms. Supportig global software development practices, e.g. frequent visits, unofficial distributed meetings, domain expert networks, and annual gatherings are described. Positive experiences of using scrum included improved communication, trust and motivation, as well as better perceived quality. Challenges included misunderstood requirements, lack of videoconferencing possibilities, and awkward communication in distributed meetings due to cultural and geographical distance.

2750.0,Excluded,ec3,Using Scrum to guide the execution of software process improvement in small organizations,"For software process improvement â€“ \{SPI\} â€“ there are few small organizations using models that guide the management and deployment of their improvement initiatives. This is largely because a lot of these models do not consider the special characteristics of small businesses, nor the appropriate strategies for deploying an \{SPI\} initiative in this type of organization. It should also be noted that the models which direct improvement implementation for small settings do not present an explicit process with which to organize and guide the internal work of the employees involved in the implementation of the improvement opportunities. In this paper we propose a lightweight process, which takes into account appropriate strategies for this type of organization. Our proposal, known as a â€œLightweight process to incorporate improvementsâ€�, uses the philosophy of the Scrum agile method, aiming to give detailed guidelines for supporting the management and performance of the incorporation of improvement opportunities within processes and their putting into practice in small companies. We have applied the proposed process in two small companies by means of the case study research method, and from the initial results, we have observed that it is indeed suitable for small businesses."

The metrics are defined using the principles of stakeholder-driven process performance measurement that requires a balanced approach considering viewpoints of different stakeholders. The goals of each stakeholder are defined first followed by the choice of appropriate performance indicators. The evaluation of each indicator is based on metric values collected during process execution. The metrics plan enables a stepwise introduction of metrics which can be incorporated into the Scrum method seamlessly without affecting the agility of the development process.

To allocate and manage \{VDC\} resources for Internet-scale desktop delivery, existing works focus mainly on managing server-side resources based on utility functions of \{CPU\} and memory loads, and do not consider network health and thin-client user experience. Resource allocations without combined utility-directed information of system loads, network health and thin-client user experience in \{VDC\} platforms inevitably results in costly guesswork and over-provisioning of resources. In this paper, we develop an analytical model viz., â€œUtility-Directed Resource Allocation Model (U-RAM)â€� to solve the combined utility-directed resource allocation problem within VDCs. Our solution involves an iterative algorithm that leverages utility functions of system, network and human components obtained using a novel virtual desktop performance benchmarking toolkit viz., â€œVDBenchâ€� that we developed. The combined utility functions are used to direct decision schemes based on Kuhnâ€“Tucker optimality conditions for creating user desktop pools and determining optimal resource allocation size/location. We deploy \{VDBench\} in a \{VDC\} testbed featuring: (a) popular user applications (Spreadsheet Calculator, Internet Browser, Media Player, Interactive Visualization), and (b) TCP/UDP based thin-client protocols (RDP, RGS, PCoIP) under a variety of user load and network health conditions. Simulation results based on the utility functions obtained from the testbed demonstrate that our solution maximizes \{VDC\} scalability i.e., â€˜VDs per core densityâ€™, and â€˜user connections quantityâ€™, while delivering satisfactory thin-client user experience."

2769.0,Excluded,ec3,Variance of the throughput of an N-station production line with no intermediate buffers and time dependent failures,"In this study, the variance of the throughput of an N-station production line with no intermediate buffers and time dependent failures is analytically determined. Time to failure and time to repair distributions are assumed to be exponential. The analytical method yields a closed-form expression for the variance of the throughput. The method is based on determining the limiting variance of the total residence (sojourn) time in a specific state of an irreducible recurrent Markov process from the probability of visiting that state at time t given an initial state. This probability function is the instantaneous availability of a production system in the reliability context. A production line with no interstation buffers and time-dependent failures is basically a series system with hot standby. The same procedure can be applied to determine the variance of the throughputs of various arrangements of workstations including series, parallel, series-parallel systems provided that the instantaneous availabilities of these systems can be written explicitly. Numerical experiments show that, although the expected throughput decreases monotonically, the variance of the throughput may increase and then decrease as the number of stations in the line increases depending on the system parameters. Numerical experiments that investigate this phenomenon and also the dependence of the coefficient of variation on the number of stations are also presented in this study."

The application of this method is presented in a practical way, by analyzing 6 software products using two different development processes: UPEDU - a scaled-down version of the organized process RUP and XP - a member of the agile methodologies. An experts' committee measured and analyzed the realization quality of each of 109 requirements of equal importance and judged them based on an evaluation vector system. Two groups of requirements were identified referring dynamic functions and static functions of the system. The observational study was conducted in an academic environment. An important contribution of this paper is the vector-based comparison method that could be generalized and applied in any other setting. The findings of this empirical study point to a potential link that may exist between the quality of the implemented requirements and the process used by the development teams."

Those habits continued when the next wave of projects with user interfaces came along. In this paper, we highlight the stories of four of our agile teams who tried vertical slicing, the challenges they faced, the victories, and the lessons learned."

2773.0,Excluded,ec3,Views from an organization on how agile development affects its collaboration with a software development team,"The purpose of this study is to investigate how agile development affects collaboration in an organization. Agile processes have received interest from the software development community during the last years as they address changes, such as new customer requirements or re-prioritization of development tasks, which is important to manage in software development. Most of the research published about agile processes are based on opinions from teams applying these processes. However, since software development is an activity where many parties often collaborate, it is interesting to investigate from an organizational point of view, how agile development affects collaboration between these teams and their organizations. An agile process based on extreme programming, XP, was applied by a team during eight months. The team interacted with its surrounding organization regularly. People from the organization which the team collaborated with were interviewed to understand how the use of the process affected their collaboration with the team. The results show that the interviewed people perceived an improvement of their collaboration with the team, as the team started develop software in an agile way.

While various requirements visualization techniques exist, only few have produced end-to-end values to practitioners. In this research proposal, we advance the literature on visual requirements analytics by characterizing its key components and relationships.

Our focus is to help software engineers manage the evolution of large and complex software systems by offering them effective and efficient ways to query and assess system properties using visual techniques. To this end, we combine several techniques from different domains, as follows. First, we construct an infrastructure that allows generic querying and data mining of different types of software repositories such as \{CVS\} and Subversion. Using this infrastructure, we construct several models of the software source code evolution at different levels of detail, ranging from project and package up to function and code line. Second, we describe a set of views that allow examining the code evolution models at different levels of detail and from different perspectives. We detail three views: the file view shows changes at line level across many versions of a single, or a few, files. The project view shows changes at file level across entire software projects. The decomposition view shows changes at subsystem level across entire projects. We illustrate how the proposed techniques, which we implemented in a fully operational toolset, have been used to answer non-trivial questions on several real-world, industry-size software projects. Our work is at the crossroads of applied software engineering (SE) and information visualization, as our toolset aims to tightly integrate the methods promoted by the InfoVis field into the \{SE\} practice."

2810.0,Excluded,ec3,When agile meets the enterprise,"AbstractContext While renowned agile methods like \{XP\} and Scrum were initially intended for projects with small teams, traditional enterprise environments, i.e. environments where plan-driven development is prevalent, have also become attracted by the promises of a faster time to market through agility. Agile software development methods emphasize lightweight software development. Projects within enterprise environments, however, are typically confronted with a large and complex \{IT\} landscape, where mission-critical information is at play whose criticality requires prudence regarding design and development. In many an organization, both approaches are used simultaneously. Objective Find out which challenges the co-existence of agile methods and plan-driven development brings, and how organizations deal with those challenges. Method We present a grounded theory of the challenges of using agile methods in traditional enterprise environments, based on a Grounded Theory research involving 21 agile practitioners from two large enterprise organizations in the Netherlands. Results We organized the challenges under two factors: Increased landscape complexity and Lack of business involvement. For both factors, we identify successful mitigation strategies. These mitigation strategies concern the communication between the agile and traditional part of the organization, and the timing of that communication. Conclusion Agile practices can coexist with plan-driven development. One should, however, keep in mind the context and take actions to mitigate the challenges incurred."
2811.0,Excluded,ec3,When hard realtime matters: Software for complex mechatronic systems,"A still growing number of software concepts and frameworks have been proposed to meet the challenges in the development of more and more complex robotic systems, like humanoids or networked robotics. The issue of hard realtime, however, has not been the main focus of such concepts, but is essential for building and controlling mechatronic systems. Here we discuss the specific demands of complex mechatronic systems and present a software concept, the â€œagile Robot Developmentâ€� (aRD) concept, which we developed at our institute to pragmatically address these demands. We show that the performance of current computing and communication hardware allows for a flexible component-based concept with distributed execution, even in hard realtime with rates in the kHz range."

2820.0,Excluded,ec3,Why an AI research team adopted XP practices,"In this paper, researchers describe their early experiences of using agile techniques while developing a solution to a specific, multi-objective real world problem called the United States Navy Sailors' Assignment Problem (SAP). Because the investigators are working in a research environment where the results produced at intermediate stages cause the requirements to continually change, an agile software development methodology was deemed most appropriate. Although the research team applied several agile practices, the paper emphasizes their experiences when performing test-first or test-driven development (TDD). When applying test-first development, the programmer writes test cases in the designated programming language prior to composing functional code. The objective during code implementation is to write code to pass a particular test case. Thus, the activities of specifying test cases, coding, and testing comprise an iterative process. As a part of this work, the authors compare test-driven development to the more traditional approaches of testing. Â©2009 ACM."

This perspective is based on the vast evidence that human aspects are the source of the majority of problems associated with software development projects. Having said that, we do not blame the humans involved in software development processes; rather, we suggest that human-related measures might be one means by which human aspects of software development processes can be supported."

2830.0,Excluded,ec6,Working towards the student Scrum - Developing Agile Android applications,"Student project teams are an integral part of the software engineering curriculum. This paper reports on the classroom experiences of student teams developing Android applications using Scrum. The course in study is a software engineering undergraduate elective in Agile Software Development which used Android mobile phones donated by Google as the development environment for student teams to learn and practice Scrum. Scrum is an agile project management framework increasingly being adopted in the development of commercial software products. When used in an academic setting it provides the opportunity to introduce and practice project management skills involving planning, estimation, tracking and identifying opportunities for continuous process improvement. As the ideal number of team members on a Scrum project is 5-9 developers, Scrum maps well from a size perspective for the typical student team collaborating on a course or capstone project. While Scrum has specific project roles and ceremonies, it is intentionally non-prescriptive on the development practices to be used in the execution of the project. In a software development project these practices are realized in the familiar software engineering life-cycles activities of requirements-analysis-design-code-testdeploy. In an Agile process these activities occur in more tightly wound incremental and iterative time boxes. Agile has also introduced variations on existing software development practices such as test first design or the frontloading of testing activities early in the development life-cycle. The paper addresses the benefits and limitations of the adoption of Scrum by a student project team and proposes recommendations for a pragmatic process framework - the Student Scrum - based on the contributions of agile processes and practices.
