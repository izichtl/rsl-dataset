1770.0,Included,included,On agile performance requirements specification and testing,"Underspecified performance requirements can cause performance issues in a software system. However, a complete, upfront analysis of a software system is difficult, and usually not desirable. We propose an evolutionary model for performance requirements specifications and corresponding validation testing. The principles of the model can be integrated into agile development methods. Using this approach, the performance requirements and test cases can be specified incrementally, without big upfront analysis. We also provide a post hoc examination of a development effort at IBM that had a high focus on performance requirements. The examination indicates that our evolutionary model can be used to specify performance requirements such that the level of detail is commensurate with the nature of the project. Additionally, the IBM experience indicates that test driven development-type validation testing corresponding to the model can be used to determine if performance objectives have been met",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software performance requirements in agile development contexts, using an evolutionary model that aligns with agile methodologies.

108.0,Included,included,A feasible user story tool for agile software development?,"User stories form the heart of the Extreme Programming methodology planning game. In its turn, Extreme Programming is one of the supporting pillars of the wider agile software development process. The user stories form a set of central work products that determine the software development processes. In the spirit of Extreme Programming the production of user stories is kept as simple as possible. Traditionally, user stories are hand written on index cards as they are easy to store, display, rearrange and distribute to the co-located development team. However, virtually all other work products of an application development team are in electronic format, and agile software development is increasingly being adopted by teams working from remote locations. In these circumstances distributed development teams look to software solutions for creating and using user stories. This paper surveys some of the tools that are being used and examines their suitability for the task using a set of requirements. As a result of this investigation the author has produced a prototype user story software tool for Agile Software Development called DotStories. The paper concludes by discussing the features of DotStories and its how closely it can approach the ideal user story software tool. Indeed, the proposition that software tools can ever improve on index cards is considered in the light of experience to date.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements in agile software development by evaluating existing user story tools and proposing a prototype tool, DotStories.

2274.0,Included,included,Sprint: Agile specifications in Shockwave and Flash,"Digital product development teams have trouble coordinating specification assets, both in the effort to represent a stable design in multiple specification forms, and particularly when a changing context causes requirement changes. The Agile process movement avoids cumbersome specifications by prescribing faster release cycles, more parallel development, and greater requirement flexibility.Sprint is both a method and a tool designed to allow an Agile approach to product development while supporting best practices for user-centered design. Unlike more comprehensive modeling and configuration management products, Sprint is for smaller teams to use for design and specification, and allows designers to stay synchronized with customers, analysts, and developers.Driven by Shockwave or Flash prototypes, Sprint links project assets, such as personas, scenarios, screen designs, storyboards, requirements, and use cases, to form interactive specifications. By eliminating asset redundancies and supporting multiple asset fidelities, Sprint reduced our administrative documentation tasks, accelerated client/user feedback, and improved team coordination.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software project requirements in an agile context, specifically focusing on agile specifications using Sprint as a method and tool.

2238.0,Included,included,Software product line scoping and requirements engineering in a small and medium-sized enterprise: An industrial case study,"Abstract Software product line (SPL) engineering has been applied in several domains, especially in large-scale software development. Given the benefits experienced and reported, \{SPL\} engineering has increasingly garnered interest from small to medium-sized companies. It is possible to find a wide range of studies reporting on the challenges of running a \{SPL\} project in large companies. However, very little reports exist that consider the situation for small to medium-sized enterprises and these studies try develop universal truths for \{SPL\} without lessons learned from empirical evidence need to be contextualized. This study is a step towards bridging this gap in contextual evidence by characterizing the weaknesses discovered in the scoping (SC) and requirements (RE) disciplines of SPL. Moreover, in this study we conducted a case study in a small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs) to justify the use of agile methods when introducing the \{SPL\} \{SC\} and \{RE\} disciplines through the characterization of their bottlenecks. The results of the characterization indicated that ineffective communication and collaboration, long iteration cycles, and the absence of adaptability and flexibility can increase the effort and reduce motivation during project development. These issues can be mitigated by agile methods.",INCLUDED,"The article is written in English (IC1), addresses software requirements engineering in software product lines using agile methods (IC1), and is based on an industrial case study (IC2).

273.0,Excluded,ec3,A web-based model for simulating whole-farm beef cattle systems,"This paper details the rationale and procedures included in a web-based simulator containing production of beef cattle and cash crops. All biophysical and economical definitions including management in terms of rules constitute user-defined scenarios, which can be saved, retrieved, modified and deleted. Herbage growth may be either provided by the user or estimated from daily climate information. Scenarios are simulated and their outcomes are sent to the user's e-mail as a spreadsheet file, including data and pre-designed graphs to facilitate the interpretation of results. An example simulation study of a grazing-based finishing beef steers with a cycle of 12 months is presented, where new weaners enter the system in the autumn. Increased stocking rates, \{SR\} (150, 170, 190 and 210 heads in a 100-ha farm) and different summer maize feeding (SMF) rates were compared (SMF0&#xa0;=&#xa0;control and SMF1&#xa0;=&#xa0;intermittent rule-driven maize feeding during summer). In this simulation study, â€œdeviationsâ€� from user-defined targets are simplified into two associated rules (a) average farm herbage mass deviation to adjust herbage allowance, and (b) target animal live weight deviation, associated to SMF1. The proportion of unfinished steers at 28th February increased linearly (p&#xa0;â‰¤&#xa0;0.01) with higher stocking rates and became zero at any stocking rate where the \{SMF\} rule was operating (SMF1). The economic response of SR&#xa0;Ã—&#xa0;SMF interaction was significant for gross margin, indicating a positive linear association (p&#xa0;â‰¤&#xa0;0.05) of \{SMF1\} treatment (rule activated) when \{SR\} increases.

225.0,Included,included,A Starting Point for Negotiations—Delivering with a Heterogeneous Team," This paper presents a counterintuitive Pre-Sprint Work Balancing methodology that has substantially increased the ability of our highly heterogeneous Scrum [1] team to deliver what it promises at the end of each sprint. The process essentially consists of preplanning steps that acknowledge both the heterogeneity in developer's time and skill level, as well as Product Owner priorities. These preplanning activities act as a starting point for negotiations with the team during the Sprint Planning Meeting.

263.0,Excluded,ec3,A tool for incorporating unit testing into a Java programming curriculum,"In the development of object-oriented programming courses, an often overlooking but important area is testing. Generally, testing is formally introduced in software engineering courses and may not form part of the practical aspects of a programming course. As a result, this concept can play a de-emphasized role during the presentation of the course material. To counteract this problem, the HF2 (Highly Extendable and Flexible) unit testing framework was created.

1079.0,Excluded,ec3,Dynamic provisioning in multi-tenant service clouds,"Cloud-based systems promise an on-demand service provisioning system along with a “pay-as-you-use” policy. In the case of multi-tenant systems this would mean dynamic creation of a tenant by integrating existing cloud-based services on the fly. Presently, dynamic creation of a tenant is handled by building the required components from scratch. Although multi-tenant systems help providers save cost by allocating multiple tenants to the same instance of an application, they incur huge reconfiguration costs. Cost and time spent on these reconfiguration activities can be reduced by re-constructing tenants from existing tenant configurations supported by service providers. Multi-tenant cloud-based systems also lack the facility of allowing clients to specify their requirements. Giving clients the flexibility to specify requirements helps them avoid spending an excessive amount of time and effort looking through a list of services, many of which might not be relevant to them. Moreover, dynamic provisioning in the cloud requires an integrated solution across the technology stack (software, platform and infrastructure) combining functional, non-functional and resource allocation requirements. Existing research works in the area of web service matching, although numerous, still fall short, since they usually consider each requirement type in isolation and cannot provide an integrated solution. To that end, in this paper we investigate the features needed for dynamic service provisioning on the cloud. We propose a novel User Interface-Tenant Selector-Customizer (UTC) model and approach, which enables cloud-based services to be systematically modeled and provisioned as variants of existing service tenants in the cloud. Our approach considers functional, non-functional and resource allocation requirements, which are explicitly specified by the client via the user interface component of the model. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first such integrated approach. We illustrate our ideas using a realistic running example, and also present a proof-of-concept prototype built using IBM’s Rational Software Architect modeling tool. We also present experimental results demonstrating the applicability of our matching algorithm. Our results show significant reduction in matching time with the help of an elimination process that reduces the search space needed for performing matching.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements in the context of agile methodologies.

In our experiences with off shoring Japanese software development projects to China, we were having difficulties with low quality deliverables and high turnover rate of Chinese members because of social differences. Our attempts to create a common culture were not very successful because people in general are less likely to change their basic views and behavior in a short period of time. We, however, were able to obtain success by acknowledging that differences are going to exist and adopting and adapting agile practices in consideration of the existence of these differences. We will show Kaizen as is used by a Japanese company in software development. We will focus on our experiences with social differences we've found and how we continuously adapted practices in our project to take better advantage of the situation as relationship between members changed. It is based on our over 10 years of experience in trying to improve a software package development at a software company in China, which has now become our subsidiary.

1238.0,Included,included,Extreme programming of multi-agent systems,"The complexity of communication scenarios between agents make multi-agent systems difficult to build. Most of the existing Agent-Oriented Software Engineering methodologies face this complexity by guiding the developers through a rather waterfall-based process with a series of intermediate modeling artifacts. While these methodologies lead to executable prototypes relatively late and are expensive when requirements change, we explore a rather evolutionary approach with explicit support for change and rapid feedback. In particular, we apply Extreme Programming, a modern agile methodology from object-oriented software technology, for the design and implementation of multi-agent systems. The only modeling artifacts that are being maintained in our approach are a process model with which domain experts and developers design and communicate agent application scenarios, and the executable agent source code including automated test cases.

However, after analyzing many of the existing traceability approaches it can be concluded that they strongly depend on traditional development process characteristics. Within this paper it is justified that this is a drawback to support adequately agile processes. As it is discussed, some concepts do not have the same semantics for traditional and agile methodologies. This paper proposes three features that traceability models should support to be less dependent on a specific development process: (1) user-definable traceability links, (2) roles, and (3) linkage rules. To present how these features can be applied, an emerging traceability metamodel (TmM) will be used within this paper. TmM supports the definition of traceability methodologies adapted to the needs of each project. As it is shown, after introducing these three features into traceability models, two main advantages are obtained: 1) the support they can provide to agile process stakeholders is significantly more extensive, and 2) it will be possible to achieve a higher degree of automation.

However, agile methodologies have not adequately modeled Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) and their potential solutions (operationalizations) with FRs in early development phases-let alone having tools to support such initiatives. This research proposes NORMATIC, a Java-based simulation tool for modeling non-functional requirements for semi-automatic agile processes. NORMATIC is the semi-automatic tool that supports the more general Non-Functional Requirements Modeling for Agile Processes (NORMAP) Methodology. Early results show that the tool can potentially help agile software development teams in reasoning about and visually modeling NFRs as first-class artifacts early on during requirements gathering and analysis phases. The tool can also aid project managers and Scrum teams in user story estimate and risk calculations as well as risk-driven planning and visualization of the proposed plans.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses non-functional requirements (NFRs) in agile software development processes, specifically focusing on modeling NFRs early in the development cycle using a visual tool (NORMATIC).

It also discusses integrated development environments (IDE), and hardware and system architecture. Methodology directly addresses the application development and project management of the upcoming project. Two of the methodologies are the waterfall method and the extreme programming model. It is noted that any number of methods can be used to develop a software project. Process model refers to building a commonality of thought processes in scope, features, deliverables, and expectations throughout the system development life cycle. It is also observed that every process model exhibits some level of requirements that need to be met and there is essentially a systems project as a deliverable to answer these requirements. The waterfall method is a deliberate and calculated system of structured development. One of the major characteristic of this type of development is the heavy emphasis on the requirements document. However, extreme programming relies on user stories. This storyboarding of ideas and concepts embraces change more readily and allows for more opportunity in what the customer actually needs and wants.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address any agile methodology, violating Exclusion Criterion EC7.

2616.0,Included,included,Towards approximating COSMIC functional size from user requirements in agile development processes using text mining,"Measurement of software size from user requirements is crucial for the estimation of the developmental time and effort. COSMIC, an ISO/IEC international standard for functional size measurement, provides an objective method of measuring the functional size of the software from user requirements. COSMIC requires the user requirements to be written at a level of granularity, where interactions between the internal and the external environments to the system are visible to the human measurer, in a form similar to use case descriptions. On the other hand, requirements during an agile software development iteration are written in a less formal way than use case descriptions - often in the form of user stories, for example, keeping with the goal of delivering a planned release as quickly as possible. Therefore, size measurement in agile processes uses methods (e.g. story-points, smart estimation) that strictly depend on the subjective judgment of the experts, and avoid using objective measurement methods like COSMIC.

1776.0,Excluded,ec3,On guiding the augmentation of an automated test suite via mutation analysis,"Mutation testing has traditionally been used as a defect injection technique to assess the effectiveness of a test suite as represented by a “mutation score.” Recently, mutation testing tools have become more efficient, and industrial usage of mutation analysis is experiencing growth. Mutation analysis entails adding or modifying test cases until the test suite is sufficient to detect as many mutants as possible and the mutation score is satisfactory. The augmented test suite resulting from mutation analysis may reveal latent faults and provides a stronger test suite to detect future errors which might be injected. Software engineers often look for guidance on how to augment their test suite using information provided by line and/or branch coverage tools. As the use of mutation analysis grows, software engineers will want to know how the emerging technique compares with and/or complements coverage analysis for guiding the augmentation of an automated test suite. Additionally, software engineers can benefit from an enhanced understanding of efficient mutation analysis techniques. To address these needs for additional information about mutation analysis, we conducted an empirical study of the use of mutation analysis on two open source projects. Our results indicate that a focused effort on increasing mutation score leads to a corresponding increase in line and branch coverage to the point that line coverage, branch coverage and mutation score reach a maximum but leave some types of code structures uncovered. Mutation analysis guides the creation of additional “common programmer error” tests beyond those written to increase line and branch coverage. We also found that 74% of our chosen set of mutation operators is useful, on average, for producing new tests. The remaining 26% of mutation operators did not produce new test cases because their mutants were immediately detected by the initial test suite, indirectly detected by test suites we added to detect other mutants, or were not able to be detected by any test.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements in the context of agile methodologies.

2047.0,Included,included,Requirement analysis in agile software development of distributed systems,"Agile methodologies (DSDM, XP, Crystal, SCRUM, etc.) have been adopted as popular approaches to software development mainly because of their capability to deliver the end product faster and incorporate changes to the requirements. Agile follows iterative development, i.e. the implementation of software systems in successive releases. A side effect of multiple releases is introducing inconsistencies to the requirements that may lead to unpredictability of the system behavior at the run-time. Unpredictable systems are hard to debug and harder to manage. It is believed that agile methods can benefit from using more quantified and yet light-weight approaches across the entire development life cycle and particularly, the analysis of requirements for correctness. Checking for consistency of requirements prior to their implementation can remove the predictability problem and lead to significant savings in time and maintenance cost. This research proposes the utilization of a software tool which employs methodologies to automatically analyze system requirements in agile development and detect inconsistencies. The portrayal of requirements via user stories in agile development is used for this purpose.

Identifying and evaluating assets are therefore key activities in any security engineering process - from modeling threats and attacks, discovering existing vulnerabilities, to selecting appropriate countermeasures. However, despite their crucial role, assets are often neglected during the development of secure software systems. Indeed, many systems are designed with fixed security boundaries and assumptions, without the possibility to adapt when assets change unexpectedly, new threats arise, or undiscovered vulnerabilities are revealed. To handle such changes, systems must be capable of dynamically enabling different security countermeasures. This paper promotes assets as first-class entities in engineering secure software systems. An asset model is related to requirements, expressed through a goal model, and the objectives of an attacker, expressed through a threat model. These models are then used as input to build a causal network to analyze system security in different situations, and to enable, when necessary, a set of countermeasures to mitigate security threats. The causal network is conceived as a runtime entity that tracks relevant changes that may arise at runtime, and enables a new set of countermeasures. We illustrate and evaluate our proposed approach by applying it to a substantive example concerned with security of mobile phones.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements in the context of agile methodologies.

1791.0,Included,included,On the Usage of Context for Requirements Elicitation: End-User Involvement in IT Ecosystems," Today's systems are faced with the need of constant evolution to remain competitive, especially when looking at IT Ecosystems and their growing number of subsystems. As a prerequisite for these to stay competitive, system providers need a clear understanding of their stakeholder's needs. As systems tend to be increasingly complex nowadays, support an increasingly number of stakeholders, have a shorter release cycles to evolve and need to adapt to the environment and the users, some of the standard requirements elicitation techniques tend not to be suitable any more. Especially when adaptivity is necessary, system providers need to understand the context, in which the systems are used, but also the context of users for the adaptation. In this paper I concentrate on the largest stakeholder group, namely the end-users for requirements elicitation. Evaluation criteria include (i) support of context, (ii) scalability to large numbers of end-users, and (iii) scalability to large numbers of end-user's needs and problems that lead to new requirements. My literature review suggests that this important field is currently underrepresented in Requirements Engineering research. This research proposes to develop a framework that explains the different context types and their role for requirements elicitation. The framework is then used to investigate existing requirements elicitation techniques and their potential for considering context.

As the emphasis of user experience work has inherently been on the early phases before starting the development, it also needs to be adapted to the Agile way of working. To improve the current practices in Agile user experience work, we determined the present state of a multi-continental software development organization that already had a functioning user experience team. In this paper, we describe the most prevalent issues regarding the interaction of user experience design and software development activities, and suggest improvements to fix those. Most of the observed problems were related to communication issues and to the service mode of the user experience team. The user experience team was operating between management and development organizations trying to adapt to the dissimilar practices of both the disciplines.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements in agile methodologies (IC1), is based on a study of a large software organization (IC2), and presents findings from a qualitative analysis of user experience practices within Agile environments (IC3 and IC4).

One means of conducting such research is through industrial case studies. However, there are a number of influencing factors that contribute to the success of such a case study. In this paper, we describe a case study performed at Sabre Airline Solutions evaluating the effects of adopting Extreme Programming (XP) practices with a team that had characteristically plan-driven risk factors. We compare the team's business-related results (productivity and quality) to two published sources of industry averages. Our case study found that the Sabre team yielded above-average post-release quality and average to above-average productivity. We discuss our experience in conducting this case study, including specifics of how data was collected, the rationale behind our process of data collection, and what obstacles were encountered during the case study.

324.0,Included,included,Acquiring and sharing tacit knowledge in software development teams: An empirical study,"AbstractContext Sharing expert knowledge is a key process in developing software products. Since expert knowledge is mostly tacit, the acquisition and sharing of tacit knowledge along with the development of a transactive memory system (TMS) are significant factors in effective software teams. Objective We seek to enhance our understanding human factors in the software development process and provide support for the agile approach, particularly in its advocacy of social interaction, by answering two questions: How do software development teams acquire and share tacit knowledge? What roles do tacit knowledge and transactive memory play in successful team performance? Method A theoretical model describing the process for acquiring and sharing tacit knowledge and development of a \{TMS\} through social interaction is presented and a second predictive model addresses the two research questions above. The elements of the predictive model and other demographic variables were incorporated into a larger online survey for software development teams, completed by 46 software SMEs, consisting of 181 individual team members. Results Our results show that team tacit knowledge is acquired and shared directly through good quality social interactions and through the development of a \{TMS\} with quality of social interaction playing a greater role than transactive memory. Both \{TMS\} and team tacit knowledge predict effectiveness but not efficiency in software teams. Conclusion It is concluded that \{TMS\} and team tacit knowledge can differentiate between low- and high-performing teams in terms of effectiveness, where more effective teams have a competitive advantage in developing new products and bringing them to market. As face-to-face social interaction is key, collocated, functionally rich, domain expert teams are advocated rather than distributed teams, though arguably the team manager may be in a separate geographic location provided that there is frequent communication and effective use of issue tracking tools as in agile teams.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements in software projects using agile methodologies, as it explores how tacit knowledge and transactive memory systems impact team performance in software development, particularly in the context of social interaction and agile practices.
