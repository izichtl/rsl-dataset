2769.0,Excluded,ec3,Variance of the throughput of an N-station production line with no intermediate buffers and time dependent failures,"In this study, the variance of the throughput of an N-station production line with no intermediate buffers and time dependent failures is analytically determined. Time to failure and time to repair distributions are assumed to be exponential. The analytical method yields a closed-form expression for the variance of the throughput. The method is based on determining the limiting variance of the total residence (sojourn) time in a specific state of an irreducible recurrent Markov process from the probability of visiting that state at time t given an initial state. This probability function is the instantaneous availability of a production system in the reliability context. A production line with no interstation buffers and time-dependent failures is basically a series system with hot standby. The same procedure can be applied to determine the variance of the throughputs of various arrangements of workstations including series, parallel, series-parallel systems provided that the instantaneous availabilities of these systems can be written explicitly. Numerical experiments show that, although the expected throughput decreases monotonically, the variance of the throughput may increase and then decrease as the number of stations in the line increases depending on the system parameters. Numerical experiments that investigate this phenomenon and also the dependence of the coefficient of variation on the number of stations are also presented in this study.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements and instead focuses on the variance of throughput in a production line with time-dependent failures, which is unrelated to software project requirements or agile methodologies.

The glossary terms are identified in two steps - a) compute units (which are candidates for glossary terms) b) disambiguate between the mutually exclusive units to identify terms. We introduce novel linguistic techniques to identify process nouns, abstract nouns and auxiliary verbs. The identification of units also handles co-ordinating conjunctions and adjectival modifiers. This requires solving co-ordination ambiguity and adjectival modifier ambiguity. The identification of terms among the units adapts an in-document statistical metric. We present an evaluation of our method over a real-life set of software requirements' documents and compare our results with that of a base algorithm. The intricate linguistic classification and the tackling of ambiguity result in superior performance of our approach over the base algorithm.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements in the context of agile methodologies, as it focuses solely on natural language requirement parsing and glossary term extraction without any reference to agile practices or processes.

1846.0,Included,included,PIP: a product planning strategy for the whole family or... how we became the brady bunch,"As a small start-up company with a heavyweight client list, Sabrix found itself at a critical crossroads in its growth in the Spring of 2003. We were consuming all product development resources satisfying commitments made to existing customers, which seriously limited our ability to react to new requirements and improve our competitive edge in the market. In the face of this resource strain, we needed to add a series of smaller, plug-in type products to our existing offering. Of course, this environment required 100% focus on day-to-day tasks and tactical issues, leaving no time or energy for looking ahead. Compounding these problems were the same issues that every company faces. A lack of trust between functional groups, with Product Development on one side and Sales and Support on the other; and, very few people in the company knew what work was being done in Product Development. When stepping back from the situation, we realized that all of the problems could be grouped into three general categories - prioritization, collaboration and visibility. To improve each of these areas, we developed the Product Input and Planning (PIP) process. PIP is a cross-functional, cross-product way of building a roadmap by prioritizing work, balancing competitiveness and customer-driven requirements, and improving product-related communication in all directions within the company. The PIP Team is responsible for prioritizing and building an 18-month roadmap, focusing on the future direction of the company, while Product Management and Product Development focus on delivering the current releases. This paper is not what one would call a success story, though it unquestionably has a moral. The PIP process as described herein exists no longer. Several factors contributed to its morphing into a different kind of family. The lessons learned over the course of the lifetime of PIP, however, are applicable to almost any large-scale, cross-functional endeavor.",EXCLUDED,"The article is a narrative account of a company's experience and does not address software requirements.

1805.0,Excluded,ec3,Operational definition and automated inference of test-driven development with Zorro,"Test-driven development (TDD) is a style of development named for its most visible characteristic: the design and implementation of test cases prior to the implementation of the code required to make them pass. Many claims have been made for TDD: that it can improve implementation as well as design quality, that it can improve productivity, that it results in 100% coverage, and so forth. However, research to validate these claims has yielded mixed and sometimes contradictory results. We believe that at least part of the reason for these results stems from differing interpretations of the TDD development style, along with an inability to determine whether programmers actually follow whatever definition of TDD is in use. Zorro is a system designed to automatically determine whether a developer is complying with an operational definition of Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices. Automated recognition of TDD can benefit the software development community in a variety of ways, from inquiry into the “true nature” of TDD, to pedagogical aids to support the practice of test-driven development, to support for more rigorous empirical studies on the effectiveness of TDD in both laboratory and real world settings. This paper describes the Zorro system, its operational definition of TDD, the analyses made possible by Zorro, two empirical evaluations of the system, and an attempted case study. Our research shows that it is possible to define an operational definition of TDD that is amenable to automated recognition, and illustrates the architectural and design issues that must be addressed in order to do so. Zorro has implications not only for the practice of TDD, but also for software engineering “micro-process” definition and recognition through its parent framework, Software Development Stream Analysis.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements in the context of agile methodologies (EC3).

Unfortunately, the traditional elicitation practices do not scale well when applied to larger projects, where knowledge is distributed across numerous geographically dispersed stakeholders. As a result, new distributed requirements elicitation tools have started to surface, such as online forums and wiki pages. In our previous work, we introduced a framework for supporting distributed elicitation by utilizing data mining and machine learning techniques to automatically group stakeholder ideas into forums, and by using recommender system technologies to help promote these forums to potentially interested stakeholders. The framework is designed to create an open and more inclusive environment where points of view, conflicts, interests and tradeoffs are identified as early as possible.

632.0,Included,included,Automated error analysis for the agilization of feature modeling,"Software Product Lines (SPL) and agile methods share the common goal of rapidly developing high-quality software. Although they follow different approaches to achieve it, some synergies can be found between them by (i) applying agile techniques to \{SPL\} activities so \{SPL\} development becomes more agile; and (ii) tailoring agile methodologies to support the development of SPL. Both options require an intensive use of feature models, which are usually strongly affected by changes on requirements. Changing large-scale feature models as a consequence of changes on requirements is a well-known error-prone activity. Since one of the objectives of agile methods is a rapid response to changes in requirements, it is essential an automated error analysis support in order to make \{SPL\} development more agile and to produce error-free feature models. As a contribution to find the intended synergies, this article sets the basis to provide an automated support to feature model error analysis by means of a framework which is organized in three levels: a feature model level, where the problem of error treatment is described; a diagnosis level, where an abstract solution that relies on Reiterâ€™s theory of diagnosis is proposed; and an implementation level, where the abstract solution is implemented by using Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP). To show an application of our proposal, a real case study is presented where the Feature-Driven Development (FDD) methodology is adapted to develop an SPL.

2244.0,Included,included,Software quality and assurance in waterfall model and XP - A comparative study,"Dealing with an increasingly volatile organizational environment is a serious challenge for managers of any software development. Traditional formal software development methodologies can be characterized as reflecting linear, sequential processes, and the related management approaches, and be effective in development software with stable, known, consistent requirements. Yet most real-world development efforts are much more likely to be conducted in more volatile environments, as organizations adapt to changing technology, markets, and social conditions. Requirements for systems must be able to change right along with them, often at ""Internet speed"" [1]. Project management approaches based on the traditional linear development methodologies are mismatched with such dynamic systems. The support of software quality in a software development process may be regarded under two aspects: first, by providing techniques, which support the development of high quality software and second, by providing techniques, which assure the required quality attributes in existing artifacts. Both approaches have to be combined to achieve effective and successful software engineering [2]. Agile methods may produce software faster but we also need to know how they meet our quality requirements. In this paper we compare the waterfall model with agile processes to show how agile methods achieve software quality under time pressure and in an unstable requirements environment, i.e. we analyze agile software quality assurance. We present a detailed waterfall model showing its software quality support processes. We then show the quality practices that agile methods have integrated into their processes.

Agile processes have received interest from the software development community during the last years as they address changes, such as new customer requirements or re-prioritization of development tasks, which is important to manage in software development. Most of the research published about agile processes are based on opinions from teams applying these processes. However, since software development is an activity where many parties often collaborate, it is interesting to investigate from an organizational point of view, how agile development affects collaboration between these teams and their organizations. An agile process based on extreme programming, XP, was applied by a team during eight months. The team interacted with its surrounding organization regularly. People from the organization which the team collaborated with were interviewed to understand how the use of the process affected their collaboration with the team. The results show that the interviewed people perceived an improvement of their collaboration with the team, as the team started develop software in an agile way.

Home computers with access to the Internet are one of the weaker links as they are typically not as well protected as computers in the corporate world. Malicious actors can not only target such computers but also use them to launch attacks against other systems connected to the Internet, thus posing severe threats to data and infrastructure as well as disrupting electronic commerce. This paper investigates the factors that affect the use of security protection strategies by home computer users in relation to a specific, but crucial security technology for home â€“ a software firewall. This paper proposes individuals' concern for privacy, awareness of common security measures, attitude towards security and privacy protection technologies, and computer anxiety as important antecedents that have an impact on the users' decision to adopt a software firewall. The results of our study suggest that attitude plays a more important role than perceived usefulness in shaping users' intention to use firewalls. We attribute this interesting finding to the non-functional nature of firewall systems that work best in the background with a complex relationship to users' productivity. Hence, the results add to our current understanding of Technology Acceptance Model vis-Ã -vis technologies that serve non-functional needs such as security. We then present a set of guidelines to home computer users, Internet Service Providers, e-commerce companies, and the government to increase home users' adoption rate of privacy and security protection technologies.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements in the context of software projects using agile methodologies.

Security refers to policies, procedures, software, and hardware designed to insure that data in information systems are protected against accidental or inappropriate destruction, alteration, or access. Properly supported, infrastructure competency allows an organization to maintain agility in responding to strategic directives and tactical changes. Infrastructure and security together provide the day-to-day operational support for the hardware and software, thus forming a critical component of the organization. Proper management of security requires attention to infrastructure and information system designs, as well as the organization adhering to strict and appropriate personnel practices. Both infrastructure and security are among the many invisible processes and resources required to implement and sustain a successful clinical computing system. Some resources, such as a data center, must be available prior to implementation of these systems; many other resources, such as those supporting security, should be available prior to implementation, but are often deferred until problems occur. Most infrastructure requirements continue and expand after the system is in use. Although organizations can purchase services through outside contracted vendors, those developing skills in their own personnel can use resources more cost effectively, saving as much as 25â€“40%, particularly in areas such as disaster management.

XP proposes many interesting practices, but it also has some weaknesses. From the software engineering point of view the most important issues are: maintenance problems resulting from very limited documentation (XP relies on code and test cases only), and lack of wider perspective of a system to be built. Moreover, XP assumes that there is only one customer representative. In many cases there are several representatives (each one with his own view of the system and different priorities) and then some XP practices should be modified. In the paper we assess XP from two points of view: the capability maturity model and the Sommerville-Sawyer model (1997).

This representative portfolio stems from a much larger portfolio of \{IT\} projects. We calculated the volatility from the function point countings that were available to us. These figures were aggregated into a requirements volatility benchmark. We found that maximum requirements volatility rates depend on size and duration, which refutes currently known industrial averages. For instance, a monthly growth rate of 5% is considered a critical failure factor, but in our low-risk portfolio we found more than 21% of successful projects with a volatility larger than 5%. We proposed a mathematical model taking size and duration into account that provides a maximum healthy volatility rate that is more in line with the reality of low-risk \{IT\} portfolios. Based on the model, we proposed a tolerance factor expressing the maximal volatility tolerance for a project or portfolio. For a low-risk portfolio its empirically found tolerance is apparently acceptable, and values exceeding this tolerance are used to trigger \{IT\} decision makers. We derived two volatility ratios from this model, the Ï€ -ratio and the Ï� -ratio. These ratios express how close the volatility of a project has approached the danger zone when requirements volatility reaches a critical failure rate. The volatility data of a governmental \{IT\} portfolio were juxtaposed to our bancassurance benchmark, immediately exposing a problematic project, which was corroborated by its actual failure. When function points are less common, e.g.Â in the embedded industry, we used daily source code size measures and illustrated how to govern the volatility of a software product line of a hardware manufacturer. With the three real-world portfolios we illustrated that our results serve the purpose of an early warning system for projects that are bound to fail due to excessive volatility.

In this paper we investigate alignment between two different documentation practices and agile development. We report upon an experiment conducted to explore the impact of formalism and media type on various dimensions of documentation practice in agile teams. 28 students in 8 teams were divided into two groups: SAD and UML. Group SAD was to update and deliver their high-level software architecture in form of a textual description defined by RUP templates. Group UML was instructed to update and deliver their low-level software design in form of UML models. Our results show that iterative documentation practices led to more extensive and more detailed textual documentation. We found that writing documentation was perceived as a intrusive task leading to task specialization and allocation of documentation to less qualified team members. Consequently, this hampered collaboration within the team. Based in our findings, we suggest that if documentation is to be delivered with the project, producing documentation should be communicated and accepted by the team as a proper product.

A large number of companies have adapted themselves with Agile processes, which, although, promise rapid software development, pose a huge burden on the development teams for continual decision making and expert judgement, when estimating the size of the software components to be developed at each iteration. COSMIC, on the other hand, is an ISO/IEC international standard that presents an objective method of measuring the functional size of the software from user requirements. However, its measurement process is not compatible with Agile processes, as \{COSMIC\} requires user requirements to be formalised and decomposed at a level of granularity where external interactions with the system are visible to the human measurer. This time-consuming task is avoided by agile processes, leaving it with the only option of quick subjective judgement by human measurers for size measurement that often tends to be erroneous. In this article, we address these issues by presenting an approach to approximate \{COSMIC\} functional size from informally written textual requirements demonstrating its applicability in popular agile processes. We also discuss the results of a preliminary experiment studying the feasibility of automating our approach using supervised text mining.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements in agile methodologies (IC1), specifically focusing on estimating functional size using COSMIC in early agile phases.

554.0,Excluded,ec3,Analysing computer science students' teamwork role adoption in an online self-organised teamwork activity,"Computer Science (CS) professionals are regularly required to work in teams to solve complex problems. Agile software development processes are increasingly popular in organisations as a method for teamwork but the self-organising nature of the method and lack of strictly allocated roles means that graduates need to know how to adopt and transition between roles effectively. While online teamwork makes team processes and behaviours transparent, educators are often confronted by the amount of data and difficulty in how to judge roles and behaviours to provide meaningful feedback to students. Furthermore, assessment of teamwork does not necessarily ignite a need to identify roles and behaviours as feedback is usually based on the product, rather than processes and behaviours. Using Dickinson and McIntyre's teamwork roles, we extend the framework to include explicit behaviours to analyse one class of students' self-organised team interactions in an online discussion space as solved open-ended problems. The collaborative activity did encourage role adoption, however not all students moved fluidly through the roles. Despite the lack of defined roles, one or two students adopted leadership roles, but attempts at leadership were not always successful. We discovered other less-obvious roles were equally important for maintaining and progressing team discussions. In this paper, we discuss the roles that emerged and suggest strategies for encouraging and assessing online teamwork. Our framework may prove to be a guide for others seeking to analyse students' teamwork and provides a guide for what behaviours a teacher might look for in online environments.

After establishing a localized velocity of five times their waterfall competitors on the same project, they moved the Indian members of the team to India and showed stable velocity with fully distributed teams. The ability to achieve hyperproductivity with distributed, outsourced teams was shown to be a repeatable process and a fully distributed model is now the recommended standard when organizations have disciplined Scrum teams with full implementation of XP engineering practices inside the Scrum. Previous studies used overlapping time zones to ease communication and create a single distributed team.

Together with the success of the Internet technology, it is often necessary to offer a web-based software solution. For Java development, J2EE builds a bridge from traditional towards web application development. Java Server Pages and Servlets allow the implementation of web sites with dynamic content. Anyway, it is still possible to apply well-tried programming paradigms, e.g. the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm. With regard to software quality as well as adaptability, application development is affected more and more by advanced testing techniques. Especially unit testing provides a powerful technique to develop new functionality as well as to extend and reuse existing parts. This is also strengthened by the success of agile processes that force test-driven development. From there, application code grows up with unit tests from scratch on. For Java, JUnit has become the defacto standard unit test environment. Nevertheless, test-driven web application development requires broadening the unit test approach.

A case study on causes and effects of overscoping in large-scale software engineering,"Context Scope management is a core part of software release management and often a key factor in releasing successful software products to the market. In a market-driven case, when only a few requirements are known a priori, the risk of overscoping may increase. Objective This paper reports on findings from a case study aimed at understanding overscoping in large-scale, market-driven software development projects, and how agile requirements engineering practices may affect this situation. Method Based on a hypothesis of which factors that may be involved in an overscoping situation, semi-structured interviews were performed with nine practitioners at a large, market-driven software company. The results from the interviews were validated by six (other) practitioners at the case company via a questionnaire. Results The results provide a detailed picture of overscoping as a phenomenon including a number of causes, root causes and effects, and indicate that overscoping is mainly caused by operating in a fast-moving market-driven domain and how this ever-changing inflow of requirements is managed. Weak awareness of overall goals, in combination with low development involvement in early phases, may contribute to â€˜biting offâ€™ more than a project can â€˜chewâ€™. Furthermore, overscoping may lead to a number of potentially serious and expensive consequences, including quality issues, delays and failure to meet customer expectations. Finally, the study indicates that overscoping occurs also when applying agile requirements engineering practices, though the overload is more manageable and perceived to result in less wasted effort when applying a continuous scope prioritization, in combination with gradual requirements detailing and a close cooperation within cross-functional teams. Conclusion The results provide an increased understanding of scoping as a complex and continuous activity, including an analysis of the causes, effects, and a discussion on possible impact of agile requirements engineering practices to the issue of overscoping.

1987.0,Included,included,Query-based requirements engineering for health care information systems: Examples and prospects,"Designing healthcare information systems is a challenge to software engineering theory and practice. Many requirements engineering (RE) methods demand user-participation, clear functional objectives and a well defined context of use. These demands are hard to meet in the healthcare domain, which is characterized by high diversity, complexity and little time and money to spend. There are many examples of healthcare software systems that have failed due to lacking investment in the early phases of design and requirements analysis. We have developed methods for gathering detailed observational data about care and communication practice. In this article, we explain how this data can be used for iterative, demand-driven, requirements elicitation and to answer design questions. The examples are taken from structured observation of actors, situations, information usage and activities at two Norwegian hospitals. We regard this approach as a useful supplement to other RE methods, in particular for agile development methods.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements in healthcare information systems using agile development methods, specifically through query-based requirements engineering.

1009.0,Excluded,ec3,Designing and implementing a measurement program for Scrum teams: what do agile developers really need and want?,"Agile developers are generally reluctant to non-agile practices. Promoted by senior software practitioners, agile methods were intended to avoid traditional engineering practices and rather focus on delivering working software as quickly as possible. Thus, the unique measure in Scrum, a well known framework for managing agile projects, is velocity. Its main purpose is to demonstrate the progress in delivering working software. In software engineering (SE), measurement programs have more in depth purposes and allow teams and individuals to improve their development process along with providing better product quality and control over the project. This paper will describe the experience and the approach used in an agile SE company to design and initiate a measurement program taking into account the specificities of their agile environment, principles and values. The lessons learned after five months of investigation are twofold. The first one shows how agile teams, in comparison to traditional teams, have different needs when trying to establish a measurement program. The second confirms that agile teams, as many other groups of workers, are reluctant and resistant to change. Finally, the preliminary results show that agile people are more interested in value delivery, technical debt, and multiple aspects related to team dynamics and will cooperate to the collection of data as soon as there tools can do it for them. It is believed that this research could suggest new guidelines for elaborating specific measurement programs in other agile environments.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software requirements in agile projects (IC1), specifically focusing on Scrum teams' needs and preferences for measurement programs.

191.0,Included,included,A pilot study of comparative customer comprehension between extreme x-machine and uml models,"Many design notations are used during software development to help the developers better understand the required system. However they are infrequently shown to clients, partly because developers believe that clients don't understand them. In this study we investigate the extent to which clients comprehend three types of diagram. Two popular UML diagrams (activity and use case) and Extreme X-Machines diagrams (a type of state diagram developed to support Extreme Programming) were shown to three clients for whom we had recently delivered the software that was represented. The clients were given some simple guidance on interpreting them and asked to evaluate how well they understood them.

It provides a case study of a large agile development project and focusses on how customers and users participated in agile development and design activities in practice. The investigated project utilized the agile method eXtreme Programming. Planning games, user stories and story cards, working software, and acceptance tests structured the customer and user involvement. We found genuine customer and user involvement in the design activities in the form of both direct and indirect participation in the agile development project. The involved customer representatives played informative, consultative, and participative roles in the project. This led to their functional empowerment- the users were enabled to carry out their work to their own satisfaction and in an effective, efficient, and economical manner.

1413.0,Excluded,ec3,"Impact of physical ambiance on communication, collaboration and coordination in agile software development: An empirical evaluation","Context Communication, collaboration and coordination are key enablers of software development and even more so in agile methods. The physical environment of the workspace plays a significant role in effective communication, collaboration, and coordination among people while developing software. Objective In this paper, we have studied and further evaluated empirically the effect of different constituents of physical environment on communication, coordination, and collaboration, respectively. The study aims to provide a guideline for prospective agile software developers. Method A survey was conducted among software developers at a software development organization. To collect data, a survey was carried out along with observations, and interviews. Results It has been found that half cubicles are â€˜very effectiveâ€™ for the frequency of communication. Further, half cubicles were discovered â€˜effectiveâ€™ but not â€˜very effectiveâ€™ for the quality/effectiveness of communication. It is found that half-height cubicles and status boards are â€˜very effectiveâ€™ for the coordination among team members according to the survey. Communal/discussion space is found to be â€˜effectiveâ€™ but not â€˜very effectiveâ€™ for coordination among team members. Our analysis also reveals that half-height glass barriers are â€˜very effectiveâ€™ during the individuals problem-solving activities while working together as a team. Infact, such a physically open environment appears to improve communication, coordination, and collaboration. Conclusion According to this study, an open working environment with only half-height glass barriers and communal space plays a major role in communication among team members. The presence of status boards significantly help in reducing unnecessary communication by providing the required information to individuals and therefore, in turn reduce distractions a team member may confront in their absence. As communication plays a significant role in improving coordination and collaboration, it is not surprising to find the effect of open working environment and status boards in improving coordination and collaboration. An open working environment increases the awareness among software developers e.g. who is doing what, what is on the agenda, what is taking place, etc. That in turn, improves coordination among them. A communal/discussion space helps in collaboration immensely.",EXCLUDED,"The article does not address software requirements; instead, it focuses on the physical ambiance and its impact on communication, collaboration, and coordination in agile software development.

In gas turbine engine control systems at Rolls-Royce, typically 50% of requirements will change between Critical Design Review and Entry into Service. Ignoring or not planning for requirements uncertainty will cause scrap and rework that will manifest later in the project. This paper evaluates the impact of not managing these uncertainties and describes how Rolls-Royce uses Requirements Uncertainty Analysis to reduce this impact.

1084.0,Included,included,Early prioritisation of goals,"Prioritisation is important in keeping a software project on track and ensuring that the stakeholder's needs are being fulfilled. In this paper four methods for goal prioritisation are examined. Using a case study as its basis, each method is evaluated on its ease of use for a stakeholder, the time it takes to complete and the amount of confidence they have that the method accurately reflects their priorities. The type of information yielded by each method is also described. The results show the techniques give a consistent priority. Grouping and ranking techniques are easier for stakeholders to perform and generally take less time than techniques showing magnitude of preference. There is also a strong correlation between the stakeholder's confidence in the technique and how easy they feel it was to perform.",INCLUDED,"The article addresses software project requirements through the evaluation of goal prioritisation methods in an agile context, satisfying IC1.
